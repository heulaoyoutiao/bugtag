	  Fine. Sometimes doesn't restart after an interruption. It would be nice to be able to play back in date order regardless of download order. If you're catching up on many episodes of some podcast, it would be nice to break away from this podcast when other podcasts have new episodes available.

	  Surprised to find that this is one of the only apps in the Play Store that supports premium subscription podcasts. That being said, I can't get the auto download feature to work and there seems to be no default sort option, requiring daily manual intervention to get podcasts downloaded and organized. Submitted a help request on these items but got no response. Would quickly run to something else.

	   This app is simple to use and very convenient. I really like the ability to play back podcasts at a higher speed. Only frustration is when I want to find a specific podcast in the 'browse gpodder' section - I end up having to Google the podcast's feed url and paste it in. Other than that great app!

	   This is the most controllable and easiest to set up podcaster I have found outside of an Apple device! This easily lets me set up how I wish to download podcast, including allowing me to add RSS feeds, and I can have them set to Auto delete from the phone once I have listened. Very impressed.

	   The only podcasts I haven't been able to find are rather small and unknown, so great selection of podcasts! Has a good amount of features as well; I always use the sleep timer. I have no intention of switching apps any time soon, and I plan to continue listening to podcasts so AntennaPod has my vote!

	   I thoroughly enjoy using this app for my podcast needs. Simple to use, and easy to find and add new feeds. Management of downloads, and files is easy too. I would recommend this to anyone that asks.

	<comment>
	   AntennaPod is at least as good as any of the proprietary podcast clients out there, but it's open source. No adds, no begging you to upgrade to pro. It does what it says on the tin and does it well. Can't ask for more.

	<comment>
	   Almost exactly what I was looking for, but I wish it would consistently play in the background with other apps (it does sometimes but not with others). Also wish it had a 'keep last [#] of episodes' feature. Lastly it would be nice if you kept drivers in mind. I'm always looking for something I can poke at quickly without becoming distracted while driving - so big fonts, big buttons, simple interface.

	<title>Not deleting old episodes</title>
	<comment>
	   UPDATE: Dec 27 - The problem I had was that new episodes weren't being DL because the old ones weren't actually being deleted from my phone. Even tho I set it to delete played episodes and they were still on my phone but not available through this app unless i re-DL the file. Need to manually delete the files using a file manager. *****DEC 26 2016. It's not downloading new episodes suddenly. I thought I should update it but that didn't help.

	<comment>
	   This app has been maybe slightly less frustrating than most podcast apps I've tried. Sounds funny, but there are too many options (for me). I want simplicity and a clean UI without too much hassle or tweaking. **As of 12/24/16 it no longer works. At. All.** I tap to open... it closes immediately. Reported issue. Everything it states last update fixed is actually what's happening NOW. (Wasnt before.) Will try another app for now &amp; try again later.

	   Clean, accessible interface, precise scrubbing controls for finding a place in a podcast. It does crash at times while navigating the app, but if you hit play and just run the app in the background it will run reliably and indefinitely. It's free, has no ads, and it works, can't ask for more.

	<comment>
	   UPDATE: podcasts started playing and things were good and then poof, all podcasts and subscriptions disappeared with no recovery options. Emailed support two weeks ago and got no response... Lame. /update No podcast would start playing whether I tried streaming or downloading. I could tap play and pause and scroll the timeline, but the podcasts would not play. Also podcast thumbnails didn't load. Pretty frustrating.

	<comment>
	   Antenna Pod meets most of what I'm looking for in a podcast app. It's had a few glitches along the way, but overall it's been good. Lately it's started to not want to turn on my home screen while playing a podcast, requiring me to press the home button multiple times before it will turn on the screen and let me unlock it. Mostly just annoying, but still. Again, overall quite good, though!

	   In my lumbering transition from iOS to Android this is the best thing yet. But it is a bit crash prone, and I just can't get used to managing everything from a touch screen. I so want an iTunes equivalent to handle my subscriptions and episodes

	  Was great. Now, with the latest update, the app freezes on completion of a podcast episode and I have to reboot my device. The list of what was fixed for the Dec 6. update shows exactly all of the ways the app crashes NOW. Instead of fixing the, they were introduced. The opposite of usable.

	  Things make this the stand out podcast app for me. 1. The ability to mono the audio. 2. The ability to use Chromecast. 3. Complete control over playlist behaviour. All this quite apart from being excellent at managing my podcast habit. ..... if only this app was available on iOS as well.

	<comment>
	   I have been trying out and installing numerous podcast apps that all seemed to refer to some old skool way of doing things. This app I just got from the get-go. It works intuitively and most used functions are just there for you, instead of tucked away in the menus. I can finally follow podcasts.

	   The widget part of the app barely works. Usually the podcast I was listening to doesn't show up, so I have to just click on it to access the podcast from within the main app. Or it shows the podcast I was listening to, but when I click the play button nothing happens. Otherwise a wonderful app.

	  Well organized. Have to download programs to guarantee reliable playback as streaming often results in backward jumps by a few seconds or ending a program prematurely, but that may be a weakness of any podcast app which interprets a hesitation in internet connection (?). I don't know. Never have that problem with videos, but frequently with podcast players.

	<title>Great free/ open source/uncluttered program</title>
	<comment>
	   Great program - free, open source, uncluttered and does the job. One small feature request that, of course doesn't diminish the above, but would be highly sensible and, judging from discussions online, there seems to be philosophical resistance to considering unfortunately- in particular. some podcast subscriptions, such as planet money, sometimes require manual download of a podcast; would be very helpful if these could be organized in and played and kept track of from the program as well.

	  Love this app but currently running into an issue: episodes won't play when I hit the play button from queue. I will click on the actual episode and hit the bigger play button and it still won't work. After maybe 10 tries it might work. Fixing this would be appreciated!

	   I use this application on a every day! It has a clear and simple UI with some advanced option such as the automatic download of new podcasts and automatically erasing old or played podcasts. I suggest two improvements: the podcast search only shows the top US podcasts. enhancing the podcast search, improving the suggestions, filtering by language or display related podcasts would be a great plus. The second point is the sync possibilities. So far, you can only sync through gpodder that times out a lo

	   Works pretty well, except for a couple issues. 1) Despite the option being selected in Settings, the play/pause controls do not persist when playback is paused for other audio. I also wish the controls persisted after playback is ended, so it is quicker to jump back into the app to select a new podcast. 2) sometimes the app glitches out, and plays the audio in the background, with no way to stop it. Press play/pause will result in two instenses of playback. I can't reproduce the issue, but it has occured.

	   It gets stuck and forces me to reboot occasionally in order to get it to work. And yes, I use cleaners to clear memory and junk files and it still gets stuck. But when it works it's great!

	  Unfortunately, app will be non responsive at times when playing audio and skipping forward all the way to the end, have to do a "force stop" in android app settings to fix. Also, gpodder constantly gives java sync error.

	  Lack of a persistent stream cache leads to a potentially long pause when resuming playback on slow networks. Other than that, does it's job well and keeps out of the way.

	   This is freaking great. I'd been using Google's Play Music app for podcasts which works pretty well but had a few issues. I started looking for a new app when a podcast I wanted want available on Play. I've used Stitcher before and find it annoying, but then I found this and I'm very impressed. The ability to search iTunes, Google pods, or directly from a URL is amazing. There's also no delay in new episodes showing up which is another issue I had with the default Google app. Plenty of settings to tweak!

	  On Samsung Note 3, Android ver 5.0: The other reviewers have hit the qualities: Very easy to use, fast behavior, refreshingly uncluttered interface. One minor gripe I have is that there is apparently no way to cancel a "download all episodes" request once it's accidentally started. Nonetheless, it's so good I would pay for this if it weren't free. Five stars well deserved.

	   Love it...switched from iOS recently and was searching for a new podcast app. After reading several reviews of various ones, this one ticks all the boxes for me and works flawlessly.

	<title>Can't Disable Lock-Screen Skip Button</title>
	<comment>
	   Overall, it's kind of a cumbersome app, but does well enough. A huge problem for me the inability, despite changing the settings, to disable the 'skip' button. I've lost my place in countless podcasts when my phone gets triggered in my pocket and the button--that I CANNOT remove--gets bumped.

	<comment>
	   Love the app. Thanks for taking the time to make it and free... Very nice. Clean simple interface, light, loads fast. One request, can you add options for the amount of time you can skip forward and backward during playback? Maybe like 10, 30, 60 seconds, selectable in settings?

	   I may look further but I am very happy with Antenna Pod. All the features I think I need, except a time adjust feature that would allow me enough time to listen to everything I want 馃榾 Long time audio book listener, just like them, choose what you like. I've subscribed &amp; unsubscribed to dozens of podcasts. Strongly recommend TWIT, Radiolab &amp; A Way with Words

	<comment>
	   Been using Pocket Casts for a long time (big fan), but I had to give this a try, since open-source software is very important to me. This has a very familiar interface, lacks nothing I "need", and it's worked as expected for me. A real pleasure to use. I've switched to this app, wholesale. Fantastic job!

	   It allows me to speed up or slow down playback speed for the podcasts I have downloaded. It has been behaving poorly on my LG G3 recently. It performs worse on my Motorola Droid. It was fun when鈥?

	    simple app for archiving, downloading, and listening to podcasts. Like that you can filter your list and sort oldest to newest and vice versa. Like that you can back up or jump 30 sec ahead. Easy setup. intuitive . Very similar functionality to podcasts app on iphone.

	   ...the play button on the widget was able to unpause. Workaround is to simply to pull up the full app and press play from there. Pause on the widget works but not play. Also, sometimes while listening to a podcast as app runs in background, the show will pause when I engage my browser app. Using Opera for Android on LG G pad f 8.0 on android 6.0

	   I came from an alternative product that had bloated into something unusable. Antenna pod has worked fine, not been a bandwidth hog but with all the normal feature needed for podcasts. My only gripe is the podcasts could do with a little more details on the selection page without going into the podcast to see the description.

	  It's a useful and beatiful clean piece of software. Nevertheless I seem not to be able to edit the download folder for instance. Unfortunately this is an option I require in order to use the app with other components.

	<comment>
	   This was a fantastic app for podcasts but recently it will skip back and replay the same content. The app will be running on screen (it doesn't matter if the phone is locked or if it is open and active), with or without earphones (no other gadget attached) and it will randomly replay the previous 15-30 seconds. This is during play with no interruptions on my behalf. Hope my updates can help find a solution, but I'm unsure if you will be alerted to the edits I've made to this..

	   I originally used this app on Android 2.4. It crashed a lot, but I really liked the UI and features over others I had tried. With my new phone, everything works and it never crashes. Really great app!

	<comment>
	   I've been podcast player shopping for a while - disappointed by SOMEthing at every turn. But finally this podcast functions well, let's me easily add to my que, speeds up and slows down, download or stream (streaming always has bumps and skips, in every player) . I love it. Because I've used so many others there are a few things that are harder to find (add all unheard episodes to que, stream =play) but the more I use it, the more i like it.

	   ...and nothing it shouldn't. I had tried many apps to follow podcasts in the past, including ones from the sites themselves (podbean, SoundCloud) but this app just does it better. Just put in an RSS feed, and boom, hassle free organizing and download of all your podcasts. Props to the devs, I wish all apps worked this well.

	<comment>
	   I have never been able to get the automatic downloads to work. And after the last update all my podcasts play too fast. Not extremely fast, but just enough to be annoying. I have disabled sonic player and it makes no difference. What is really weird, is the podcasts start out really fast, but after 10 or 15 seconds they slow to almost normal, but not quite.

	<comment>
	   I have previously been a BeyondPod and Podcast Addict User and while they're both good, they can also both be heavy &amp; clunky to navigate. This app is much cleaner in layout, everything is in a logical place. There is also plenty of room for customisation like filtering your auto downloads in a feed by keyword, and automatically adding downloaded episodes to your queue. This is an excellent app. 5 Stars.

	   I tried several podcast apps before Antenna Pod. There were pros and cons for each, some had a good selection of podcasts, but lousy design. Others had better design but I couldn't get all my favorite podcasts. Antenna pod has a pretty good layout and finds all podcasts by searching iTunes. Pretty good idea. I recommend it!

	<title>Faster playback would be better.</title>
	<comment>
	   It'll playback at x2 the speed which sounds fast at 1st but now that I'm use to it I would love it to go to at least 2.5 or maybe 3? Apart from that - good app.

	   I tried half a dozen different podcast apps before finding one that was actually intuitive to navigate. The only quibble I have is that I had to plug in feed addresses for a couple of my more obscure casts that some others found, but that's a small price to pay for a decent interface!

	  Would have loved to use this open source podcaster but the constant lagging, the delay in resuming a paused podcast, and the sucking up of battery power are all frustrating right now. Hope it improves down the line so I can try it again.

	   I love the search function that helps you find new podcasts. My old player didn't have that function. Very easy to add new podcasts, download episodes, and play. It would be nice to be able to change the que easier, but that's a fairly minor problem. Overall, i love it and will be sticking with it!

	   I've tried a bunch of different podcast apps, using each one for a couple of weeks if they seemed promising. And this one is by far the best one. It's super intuitive to use without lacking necessary features which to me is the most important.

	   It works right. If you want to listen to streams or read news from RSS, this is the app you should use. The only thing I would change is to add a more useful and obvious "home screen" for an overview of subscriptions and what's playing, so I don't back button all the way out of the app so frequently.

	<comment>
	   The interface is nice and simple and adding podcasts could not be easier. Playing from a stream has been uneven at best. Stream will drop and will not come back without phone reboot and even then sometimes it won't play. Of course, I could download but that's not the point. Other than the streaming issue antenna has been great.

	   Went from iOS to Android, this is the best equivalent I could find to listen to my podcasts. Everything seems to work perfectly, I particularly enjoy the batch processing features. The only thing I miss is the iTunes podcast store, but I guess there are plenty of other ways to explore what's available.

	   Antenna is a fine podcasting app. I have some minor niggles with the user interface and I can think of several improvements to the management aspect s. Apart from thatI have the source and I'm using it to help learn android development. All in all, a real jewel of an app.

	   It's free, fairly easy to use and feature rich. One star off for occasional bugs, like playing the first few seconds of a podcast before skipping to the next track for no particular reason.

	   Since moving to android from iOS I've been looking for a decent podcast app. After searching the play store, online reviews and top 10's then trying them all out I was still disappointed. Ads, cluttered layouts, and complex apps were all I found. However in a comments section I saw this app recommended, and I must say its great. Not just because I couldn't get on with the others but this app is easy to use and manage your subscriptions and episodes, has a good layout that's both aesthetic and user friendly.

	   I use this app often especially commuting to work. However it stops suddenly about 20 mins during my commute. I am not sure if that is my phones internal sleep mode or the application. However it is a great app to use to listen to your favorite podcasters.

	<comment>
	   Bottom Line: It does everything I want, ad free. Every time I thought it was lacking a feature, I eventually found how to do it in the Settings because there are A LOT of options in the Settings. Small Complaint: After I selected my podcasts, I wanted to use it on my PC, but it's Android only. Also, I had to wipe my Android phone, but couldn't figure out how to save my podcast list, and had to reselect them all after phone was reset. But it's a great App.

	<comment>
	   AntennaPod is pretty and it consistently loads podcasts' artwork. It also has useful sharing features and I like the way that it organizes episodes. My only complaint is that it exhibits odd back-button behavior, often bringing me back to Android home instead of the previous page in the app. Also, playback occasionally stops when running Waze. This behavior is rare enough that I haven't bothered to investigate.

	<comment>
	   Simply the best of the free podcasts players out there. It doesn't have a splashy UI or "fancy" extra features -- just the podcasts you want. Easy to stream or download. Unlike some plays who use their own databases or RSS feeds, this one pulls straight from Apple podcasts! No more will your favorite podcast be unavailable to you, if they upload to iTunes (almost everyone does), you'll have perfect updated access to it. I recommend this player to anyone new or old to podcasts.

	   Definitely my favorite podcast app yet. It has a few features in grateful for, that I didn't think I'd use since other apps didn't have them. The little storage and queue tweaks are very welcome. It could use an increase in cache size and the ability to limit a number of episodes instead of cache, but that's it.

	   Can easily find and download all my favorite podcasts so I can listen without having to be connected. Good user interface. I used an ipod touch for years and I think this app is going to allow me to just use my phone for podcasts now.

	<comment>
	   I've been using AntennaPod for about 6 months and I have found that it well suited to collecting and listening to podcasts. I try to use open source whenever I can but sometimes find the applications to be very rough and difficult to navigate. This is not the case with antennapod so I would recommend this app to anyone looking for a straightforward and dependable podcast manager.

	   Would you believe how many podcasting apps there are? And how difficult it was too find a good one. Well after trying many over the last few years, this one finally fits the bill: it has clean, clear and simple interface, yet is flexible enough to do everything I want - search podcasts, simply skip forward and back, automatically delete after listening, change playback speed. My only wish is that it would remember the speed and volume setting for each subscription.

	   You should use this app. I've been using Antenna for a few years now and continue to grow my appreciation for it every update -- heck every *day*. I paid for a few podcast apps before getting turned onto Antenna so I feel especially qualified to proclaim that this is the best podcasting app that bandwidth can get. It's free, updated surprisingly often, and feature robust. It works excellently and has continued to improve since I began using it.

	   Does everything I expected. Specifically: allows you to listen to podcasts in chronological order. Go to your queue and tell it to sort by date released. Several of the other podcast apps don't allow that to happen. They responded and I was mistaken. There is an option to download all episodes. Perfect app

	   Full disclosure....I am not associated with the author(s) of this app and I feel no need to give gushing reviews. That said, this is the perfect app for anybody who wants to download, manage, and mow through podcasts. I have tried at least 20 other apps and only found 1-2 others that allow me to access and listen to podcasts like this one does.

	   Just switched back to Android. I was going to keep the iPhone for podcast listening because podcast apps aren't really that great in Android. However, Antennapod has all the features I need to leave my iPhone behind. I use a Google Nexus 5x with Marshmallow.

	   This app works very well, and makes it easy for me to find and try new podcasts, listen to a rotation of different podcasts, optionally download episodes over wifi to avoid high data use, and track which episodes I've listened to. Doesn't lose track of what you're listening to regardless of phone calls, reboots, or long-term pauses.

	   I haven't tried many more, but that's because once I found this one, I stopped looking. It hasn't changed my life or gotten me in shape but it does everything you'd expect and it's quite configurable. It did ask me to rate it, but only after a long while of using it, so it convinced me.

	   With the latest update this player leaves all the others in the dust. Paid and unpaid. No esoteric resource hungry featured. Incredibly stable. Good looking working perfectly for a podcast addict like me. This is my most used app. It's playing 6-12 hours a day! It never ever fails and with the Sonic player built in it sounds great even through my high end ear buds. I really want to pay for this app! For me it's worth double digit dollars Try it. Love it and move on. This is THE player right now!

	   I'm very pleased with AntennaPod. It does exactly what it says on the label and it does it very well. It allows you to subscribe, download and organize your podcasts in a very intuitive way without any extraneous bells and whistles, and it just works. As other reviewers have said, it's a far better, more user-friendly app than many commercial podcatchers I've tried, so kudos to the AntennaPod team for keeping it free and open source!

	   Like many other reviewers here, I've installed and rejected countless pod apps during my 7 years with Android phones. Antennapod is, by a considerable margin, the best I've used. Without fuss, it seems to have all the features I want, and none of the bloat I don't need. I'd happily pay for it if it didn't happen to be free...

	   This is an excellent bit of coding, you get everything you get from the paid for podcast apps for free. Shame there wasn't a donation option I would gladly donate a couple of pounds to the developer or his chosen charity.

	  This is the best Podcast app I've found. I tried 3 other podcast apps and they don't come close to AntennaPod. I love the speed up feature. A Lot of podcasts don't have commercials and if you don;t like a topic then just fast forward to the next. Who knew an one hour show on the radio is really only 34 min or less on a podcast.

	   So many features. Search, download and play without a lot of fiddling--but gives you control when you want. I play most things at about 1.8X speed. They all sound good. Love that it is open source--excellent quality, no ads. Thanks!

	   Edit2: While not on wifi will update subscriptions but doesn't download the actual podcasts. As soon as I get a wifi connection the episodes start to download. There are no errors or entries in the log. It doesn't look like it's attempting to download until I get wifi. 'Mobile updates' is switched on.

	<comment>
	   I tried a lot of others since Google abandoned thier Listen app and this is the best replacement in my opinion. Nice looking, functional interface. All the queueing, playback, and download options I need. You can automate downloads for each subscription. Queue playback settings help avoid accidental deletion or skipping. Very granular settings, which I like. But easy enough to operate while driving or walking. Playback speed is still in beta as of this review but has been working fine for me.

	   I really really like this podcast app. Being new to podcasts in general I was put off by all the podcast apps that had to be bought. I can understand why you would buy one. But how would I know I would keep listening to podcasts enough to justify me buying anything. I looked for several free options until I stumbled into antennapod. So far i love it, and really appreciate that it is open source. You guys have really done the world a service with your app.

	   This is my second full use podcast app, I used another one for many months that started to crash my phone, using its free version, so I was not about to pay for it when free was messing with Android. With AP, everything runs smoothly, getting new episodes is easier and sound is always consistent. I will update if any issues or other great things arise! So far so great.

	   Simple, handy player and downloader. Like the speed controls and jump forward and back buttons. Would be useful to have up / down speed buttons instead of a one-way scroll. Embedded player is accessible from file list that includes files not d/led with the app, though in this use it doesn't remember the position of paused files.

	   it lets me keep track of all my podcasts and it has tons of customization options (the most useful of which I've found is the auto-dowload/delete setting) plus, I've yet to see an ad. try it! 馃憤

	   Not only it's open sorce but also free of charge and it works great! It doesn't get in the way, earbud controls work, it behaves as expected, supports downloading episodes for off-line listening, and it's not married to a podcast provider.

	   Three cheers for open source!!! This app is a first class podcast manager with great features for power users while still being simple enough for newcomers. The development community is responsive to bug reports. All around a great example of what quality open source on Android can be :)

	   Switched to this a few weeks after DoggCatcher started glitching on me, haven't looked back. My only gripe is the way downloaded episodes are automatically added to the queue - I find it annoying when something starts playing when I didn't set it to. .

	   I've tried a lot of podcatchers, but keep coming back to this. It's simple, but it just works, except for the occasional crash, or download error. Which happens often enough that I have looked for other options. But despite those issues, I'm still a big fan of this app. Thanks for making it, folks

	   Haven't looked back since I've installed it. Only request: the ability to download and queue an episode of a podcast I'm not subscribed to. Right now, I download manually and tell my launcher to open with Antenna Pod. Inconvenient but manageable.

	   This is a great podcast player with what seems like a reasonable amount of permissions... For free. It has all the bells and whistles I could want save for a tweak here and there (e.g.: perhaps a better way to distinguish which podcasts you've already heard... The grey text is quite close to plain black). All in all, a great app. Highly recommended!

	<comment>
	   Great but some problems just arose. 1. I can't scroll through an episode. The 30 second forward/back button doesn't work. 2. Jumping to the middle with the scroll bar will work once but it just jumps to a random place that doesn't match the scroll position. It won't respond to any other junior after that. 3. The episode won't stop playing. The pause button won't work. Closing the app won't work. I have to force stop through settings.

	<comment>
	   After a recent update I have found a few problems when one episode has finished and moving on to the next. The playback stalls and freezes and plays intermittently, and won't allow me to 'come out' of the episode. The only way to do this is to close the app itself and open it again. Having said that, I have tried a few podcast apps on my android phone and this has suited me better than those up until the recent issues, so I will probably continue to use it and hope that updates resolve the problem

	   This is the only podcast app I've used and I like it. It does the job and is really straightforward. And now that I have figured out to swipe things out of my queue it's much less cluttered. I would like more browsing possibility when looking for new podcasts but I'm not sure if that's the app or user error

	  This app has continually improves; truly impressed! The lock screen widget is really handy for pausing / unpausing, and the variable speed playback is a real time saver! If I had one request, it'd be for YouTube subscriptions -- I can't get valid podcast XML out of YouTube directly, so application level support would be required required to add Youtube videos to the playback Queue.

	<comment>
	   I'll start here, if you don't care about Foss or privacy or the like, this isn't your app. Compared to say podcatcher it's missing three features, the ability to use video podcast, the ability to skip silence, and the ability to subscribe to YouTube channels (probably not as important to you as me) but it's free (as in speech) and it does what it says on the tin so five stars irregardless.

	   I cant wear headphones at my job, but I do anyways. The pause on headphone jack removal and autoplay on reentry is a practical solution. The 30 second rewind button is the perfect amount for podcasts where I had to answer a phone and remember what the cast was talking about.

	   I love the simplicity. It just works and it has what you need. Not overly complicated but just a great podcast app. Needs one fix. Need to be able to set ANY path for storage. I am not able to set the path to my external SD card so it wants to use internal storage for everything which is very limited.

	  Works well, haven't had any major problems or issues. Pause button went unresponsive once or twice but I think that may have been an issue with my phone since it was an isolated incident and I've been using the app for a few months. Would recommend this app, it does what it's supposed to well and over all I'm pretty happy with it

	   This app does what it is supposed to with a clean interface and easy access to new podcasts. I tried several other Android podcast apps with unnecessary features and terrible UIs and could not comprehend why there were no simple apps that worked without crashing or stalling to load ads. This is everything I need in a podcast app.

Oh, wow, thanks for setting me straight on what this review box is for. Now where do I report the issue that the issue tracking link in Settings is grayed out? I guess it's not here?

	<comment>
	   I love this app but the latest update is acting weird on my nexus 5x. Whenever I try to use the audio controls to pause or play, the entire app stops responding. It does not crash however. When I close the app from the app list , it still continues to play in the background and I have no way of stopping the audio unless I force quit the app. Very annoying, I can't use any of the audio controls without this happening.

	<comment>
	   Dear Developer, this app is beautiful and I just love it. Yet, there's just one bug which bugs me night and day: there being no code to manually and automatically pause downloading, half the time the downloads result in errors, on our slow connection speeds of 512 kbps. I'd request you to kindly implement this in an update so that we no longer face this problem that makes one's head boil with anger. Thank You.

	   Really useful app. The only thing - I don't know - why application may be closed by OS or unloaded from RAM while I'm listening it. UPD: it looks like app process has less priorities than other ones. Or Android just kills background audio service. Steps to reproduce: just continue using your phone, running new apps and at the end application will close.

	   I listen to podcasts to pass the commute time. Then started getting too many podcasts to keep up with. The speed setting on this app is great, I can listen at 3x speed and keep up with all my favorite content. Queue management works nicely too.

	   Update: problem no longer occurring, and some nice improvements to the interface on newer versions. Now Five stars. Not giving 5 stats because the latest version seems to get stuck on a podcast every note and again, and won't play another podcast until it is shutdown and started again. Other than that, works great.

	   Love this app but I have an issue. When the app is already running on my phone and I connect to my car's Bluetooth 50% of the time no audio comes through. Only fix is to kill antennapod, disconnect and reconnect Bluetooth and restart the app.

	<comment>
	   Every time I play a podcast, it freezes. Sometimes it'll actually play, but a lot of the time it simply crashes. Incredibly annoying. Also, after adding a podcast, you have to go through several steps to get to the newly added podcast to play it. This is on a Galaxy S5

	  I have one podcast that I listen to, and I had lots of problems adding it to my subscriptions. After that, the app worked great. EDIT: The problem was that adding the podcast through iTunes search had it stuck after selecting it, and adding through feed URL was taking a significantly long time as well (I think it was stuck). The latter eventually worked so I can't complain.

	<comment>
	   There aren't a lot of simple, easy to use podcatchers left, so this one is a breath of fresh air. That being said, there are some bugs that pop up from time to time. The app un-foregrounds itself sometimes after just pausing a podcast for a second. Sometimes I can't download an episode I know is fine in a feed. I've had it crash randomly. Hopefully as the app matures more, the kinks will be ironed out.

	<comment>
	   It's ok, I think they may be attempting to incorporate more features and capabilities than what many of us really want or need. Like so many other developers out there need to understand, less can sometimes be just the right recipe to a fortune. Make a product which performs the basics then offer add-ons to allow the user to customize to suit the individual needs. Just remember, there are no instructions with most apps, isn't that just wrong? So, keep it simple to understand, then let the "customer" decide!

	   Great ad-free experience. Sometimes I encounter bugs where playback continues and I can't stop it. There have been other bugs in the past that have been squashed over time so I expect this will be done with in time. Really like the new search iTunes feature, it makes adding podcasts super easy.

	<comment>
	   You can manually add a podcast, or browse for some and the search function generally finds them all, playback is simple, although I wish the lock screen notification wouldn't go away when I paused it. Sometimes podcast refreshes take a long time, but other than that it's perfect 馃槉 plus being able to backup your podcast preferences is great!

	   Have used AntennaPod for ages, and totally love it. Great features and does the job 99% of the time. Sometimes randomly stops for no discernable reason. Apart from these niggles, though, it's the best friend of a podcast enthusiast.

	   I have been using Antennapod for a while now and really enjoy all the features it offers. The only issue I have is that it's hard for me to figure out what episodes are new vs. Not listened to yet.

	   My requirements are very limited and this pod catcher fulfils them perfectly. It does not appear to be too demanding of my Nexus 4 and is very reliable, I use it daily and I am more than satisfied with its performance.

	  I really liked this app on the Z3. Unfortunately it does not work well with bluetooth-audio on Z5 (HSP via Mono Bluetooth Router pro). Sound is muted almost every time when the next episode starts... Not usable anymore.

	   Originally used stitcher which was to rated but not all that great. Setup takes a bit longer in antenna pod than stitcher, but this app actually stores podcasts to sd card rather than holding then in the phones ram. Benefit: when you go on a 7 hour road trip you actually have something to listen to instead of only having the two podcast in your phones ram. This is simple with no ads. It just works!

	   EDIT: thanks for the reply,I found the per podcast settings. It would be great if we had more options per podcast. E.g. to be able to set one podecast autoclean every 2 days, and another every 2 weeks. Other than that, it is an excellent app, stable, light, functional,intuitive, well designed, and has active devs. I tried a bunch of other podcast apps and I found this one to be the best for me. Furthermore, if you had a donate option I'm sure a bunch of us would chip in something.

	  Very nice and light, what makes it stand out imo is no disturbing ads and player available as widget and lockscreen notification - so play and pause can easily be controlled without need to open the app when playing in the background or even unlock the phone when playing on the go. On the minus side, lacking some individual settings per subscription (for example on a daily cast I'd like to keep episodes for a couple of days but not a full week, and for a weekly at least a week) and some news podcasts with 1000s of old episodes take a bit long to load.

	   Useful feature set (options to download on wifi only, scheduled updates, auto-delete episode after listening, max number of episodes to keep, etc.) and clean interface but uses about twice as much memory (95mb) as BeyondPod. AntennaPod also doesn't have ads!

	   This app is the prime example for an excellent open-source project. I'm just a little bit confused, how to remove pods from the queue, which are not played completely to the end. Because a different context menu will be shown. Sometimes I'm also unable to delete the last pod in the download list. The delete button is still there, but no action follows.

	<comment>
	   Confusing as to what's downloaded and what's "queued", some podcasts downloaded on wifi suddenly missing now that I'm on 4g. Multiple entries of same podcast. Fix this and I'll come back, going to something more straightforward in the interim.

	<comment>
	   My main podcast finding, following, downloading, and listening app. No more messing with meta tags and scattered sources. Objectives of some features are still a little obscure to me (logs vs episodes vs queue) but I'm using it with 0 problems and with all the utility stated above. When I figure these additional features out I'm sure I'll be even more pleased. 2 thoughts: 1) tooltips might have helpful educational utility. 2) searching and adding podcasts isn't the prettiest.

	   It does the job well enough. The best podcast app that does auto downloading, and the only one that does it without ads. It's buggy here and there, but it's missing only a few features I would want and it being open source mute than makes up for that.

	<comment>
	   When I unplug it stops playing and I can plug in again the next day and it starts just where I left off (a few seconds earlier so I can pick it straight up again). I can filter by download or unheard. Finding new podcasts by url or searching the itunes store makes discovering new podcasts easy. I would like if I could group similar podcasts together or a "people who downloaded this also downloaded..." feature, but this isn't essential. Would definitely recommend to friends.

	  While I like antennapod a lot and have been using it for years, it has finally failed me completely. It no longer plays my podcasts, particular ones from NPR. It has been getting worse in the last few months where it would fail to start the podcast after one completes. It basically hangs and has be killed. I've started to reboot, in hopes of clearing the problem, but that no longer works. I have a Nexus 5 freshly updated with latest Marshmallow. I usually try to find the download podcasts using the file manager, but I forgot where it was putting them. Please make it work reliably again. Thanks

	   This app is perfect for podcasts. It's simple and lacks the obtrusive features and interface elements of most comparable apps.

	   Got nothing more to say, it serves it's purpose, is incredibly flexible yet simple in design, and doesn't seem to face a lot of the issues I had with other players/aggregates.

	<comment>
	   It plays podcasts, manages a queue from subscription feeds, and has a few bells and whistles. It's almost a perfect app. The widget is a bit too simple, and large at the same time. The UI has an unrefined quirkiness that causes frequent irritations. But, it's free, it works, and if I wasn't so lazy I'd dive into the source. Thank you!

	<title>Free and Open Source Podcatcher</title>
	<comment>
	   Antennapod has become everything I could want from a Podcatcher. Starting from adding your first podcast, the GPodder integration means you will probably never have to search for an XML file again, since it will already be searchable in the gpodder directory. Other useful features include a sleep timer, excellent crash recovery (though crashes aren't that frequent), and headphone awareness. I'd recommend giving it a try before throwing a few bucks to another Podcatcher.

	   The only aspect preventing me from leaving 5 stars is the search feature is limited to iTunes or gpodder. Check Podcast Addict for that feature. 5 stars when I don't have to use 2 apps to search for/enjoy my podcasts.

	   Update: I got a same-day response pointing me to a setting that does exactly what I was asking for! It would be great if the notification didn't disappear when I tap the stop button. Usually I'm just stopping the playback temporarily during an interruption and I want to restart playback after a few seconds or minutes. If the notification were still there I'd just press the play button to get going again. The Google Music player notification does this and I like it that way.

	   This app is not bug free, for instance around August 2015 it started to crash when playing down loaded content, so I installed google play to do that. However, all of that is outweighed by the fact that this is OSS software, and I use it daily.

	   This podcatcher app is better than the others I tried. It is also nice that the team continues to improve the app. Only frustration is app seems to still be unable to store podcasts on SDcard. App doesn't appear to have write permission due to Google's "security" features on Lollypop.

	   Really awesome! I like that it integrates with iTunes now. Sometimes it's slow to refresh my feeds (and by slow I mean 20-30 seconds) but that might have to do with my Internet/LTE provider.

	<comment>
	   Looks good and runs simply. The app is constantly being updated, and if you submit bug reports or feature requests on their github they are fairly good about responding. Sometimes updates will introduce small bugs and the app is probably not the cutting edge in podcasting technology, but it is solid and always improving.

	<comment>
	   This app is great and has all the basic functionality that you look for in a podcasting app. I feel like there are some design optimizations that could be made to the user interface as it is a little clunky at the moment, especially the pullout drawer and the swiping behavior which is not very intuitive, at least to me. Also this might be a bug but the white icons and text are impossible to see on notifications. I also think adding more material design could improve the ui.

	   Overall this is my favorite podcast player on Android. Easy to add feeds, and I like the way it manages them within the app. It allows for downloading episodes, and it remembers playback positions. Only downfall is that it sometimes becomes unresponsive, but a force stop usually resolves the problem.

	<comment>
	   The only gripe I have about this app is the fact it doesn't do well when my cell signal is bad. I have an unlimited data plan so automatically downloading episodes would be a huge pain for me but if I have very little signal and I accidentally stop playback, I have to wait for it to start to play again. Preferably the app would cache the episode as I play it so I wouldn't have to worry about it but I still have this issue. Also sometimes a random episode won't play. I have no idea why.

	   For the advanced sleep timer, is it possible to extend the time window during which a phone shake will reset the timer? Right now, it feels too short; between the notification (that the timer will soon be up) and the stoppage of playback there's only a couple of seconds. Thanks!

	  WIth the latest update, it is now VERY difficult to re-arrange podcasts in the queue. The queue is the best feature of this podcast app, and it would be nice if it could be returned to the way it used to be. On the other hand, it now seems to work better with the play/pause button on my bluetooth headphones, so thanks for that.

	<comment>
	   Only one real issue I have is that usually, but not always, when auto-advancing the playlist the player freezes. Pressing pause brings up an "unknown error" dialog, which then drops you back into the queue. Selecting a different podcast usually, but again not always, restores playback.

	   Useless if you can't open it and use it!!! IN RESPONSE TO YOUR RESPONSE: I reinstalled it, but just how am I supposed to send you a crash report IF I CANNOT OPEN THE DANG APP???? I can't get anything except the Google play page that says it's installed. It doesn't show up on my phone except to say it's been successfully installed. No option to open the app, nor does it show up in phone as an app that I have.

	   Android does not have the equivalent of I tunes when it comes to podcasts. I have been looking for a solution for almost a year and I finally found one. I would also like to mention that I have previously tried podcast addict and tunein but both were unsuccessful at providing a service that is comparable to this one.

	   I've tried other major players around and I'm settling with thisone. Maybe I might want discovery, recommendation feature which I think, is missing but no complain as the player dose basics quite well. Free and no ads open source, I think this is a win. A note to the developers, I experience my xperia m4 freezes when I try to stream but the server is not responding ( download fails with 403 error or something)

	<comment>
	   I've been an Instacast user on iPhone for a long time and after migrating, it took me some time to find the right podcast manager for me on Android. After trying beyondpod, pocketcast and a couple more, I turned to the open source alternative Antennapod. What I like most is the Auto-Flattr feature. It allows me to contribute cash to my content creators and to Antennapod themselves - glad to be a part of it! Antennapod also has chapter marks, deals with big feeds and is highly customizable.

	   I previously used AntennaPod with the Prestissimo plug-in, but when one or the other was upgraded, it killed functionality. Once I removed Prestissimo, AntennaPod returned to normal. Lack of variable speed is why I only rate this 4 stars. Otherwise this is a great app.

	   It's an elegantly understated app in a category filled with insanely overstimulated offerings. However, I noticed that it doesn't integrate with AutoMate. I'd like to work on this if possible but I don't know much about Android development. If it could work with AutoMate, it'd be five stars.

	   Everything works wonderfully. Only thing I'd really like to see in future updates is full player controls on the widget and lock screen components. I often skip back a few seconds to re-listen to things I might've missed, but I have to unlock my phone and open the full app to do that right now. Relatively minor, but it'd be a useful feature.

	<title>Podcasts Fail to Load--often. Forces App to Close</title>
	<comment>
	   I thought maybe it was my phone, but when I upgraded, i continued to have problems on BOTH phones. It's gotten so bad that it is making this app close to unusable. Please help!

	   I miss the fact you could skip episodes on the lock screen but that feature was took away and you could see How long into the podcast again gone from lock screen but everything else is excellent and by far the best podcast app out there

	<title>Invisible notification texts</title>
	<comment>
	   Good podcast app! One issue: the notification texts are invisible when not expanded, probably because the podcast titles are too long, causing it to wrap the texts completely.

	   I came from an Apple iOS environment and this is the best Podcast app replacement I have found. I tried half a dozen until I came across AntennaPod, I found it when it had less than 10,000 downloads. I thought it was perfect from the beginning but every update has been surprisingly useful, especially the integration of iTunes search. Thank you so much Daniel for a superb app!

	   I haven't loved a podcast manager this much since Listen by Google. Configurable auto downloads, rearrange the queue by drag'n'drop, uses the iTunes directory, perfect. I wish that variable speed playback didn't require a plugin, but that's minor.

	<title>Very good, question about adding podcasts with lots of existing episodes</title>
	<comment>
	   Hi there, This app is excellent, you guys are doing a great job. I have a question about using the app. I added a podcast that has over a hundred existing episodes. I would like to listen to it starting with the oldest episode first because it is a serial and I'd like to follow the storyline. Is adding each old episode to the queue manually the only way to listen oldest to newest? That's a lot of scrolling and clicking. The way I understand antennapod's use seems great for staying current with podcasts, but difficult for listening to old casts. Is there a way to use antennapod in that way? I saw on github a feature request to "add all to queue", that would probably do it. Also, I tried emailing the google group but it bounced back. Thanks for your help, I greatly appreciate it.

	<title>Update: Good, simple Podcast App</title>
	<comment>
	   In general, AP is a great, simple podcast app. There was previously an issue with how Podcasts were organised, but this has been fixed in a new update. The developers seem keen to fix issues and continue to improve the app. An area of improvement would be adding new podcasts: searching and browsing popular pods or recommendations would be useful.

	   Used to be good, but won't show which podcasts it has failed to refresh. Podcast Addict doesn't have this problem so will be using that from now on. Update: The app will not show me which podcasts have failed or succeeded to download. Podcast Addict shows that certain podcasts have new content, this app does not right now.

	<comment>
	   This app has come a very long way since i first started using it. To tge point where if i decided i no longer believed in open source tomorrow i would keep using this app anyway. If you're looking for a podcasting app that's free and doesn't bloat your phone with ads and data collection, this is the way to go. If you're simply looking for an elegant podcast app, this is still the way to go.

	<comment>
	   sometimes it works perfect sometimes it doesn't. there's no response to let you know you've clicked. if it stops for any reason such as you stop it, another apt interrupts it, or you lose your connection...there's only a 50 percent chance it's going to start again. there's constant freezes where you have to wait 5 minutes even after you close it.

	<comment>
	   This app needs configuring on first use to work well. Once configured properly this is the best podcast app I have used. Straight-forward but full featured. There are a few minor bugs here and there which can be overlooked. Adding more podcasts than the choices listed seems difficult and possibly buggy; it probably requires reading some instructions which I did not read.

	   Really love the queue and option to stream podcasts. Auto start when something is plugged in the headphone jack is brilliant. Sorting the queue is a great new feature, just wish the duration option would go by how long is left rather than total length.

	   ... 眉bersichtliche UI ... einfach zu bedienen ... Wiedergabegeschwindigkeiten ... keine Werbung ... Open Source! Nur leider fehlt mir (a) Chromecast- (must have) und (b) Wear-Support (nice to have). Darum nur 4* - ich komme trotzdem immer wieder zu dieser App zur眉ck :)

	   It follows Google's design guidelines, free, ad-free, and open source. On top of those things, very nice functionality and I've never felt the need to search for another Podcast app, highly recommended.

	   I liked it but I prefer backing up my podcast episodes. can you please add "offline episode detection"? for example, I downloaded an episode from my computer and placed it in the config folder of antennapod. it should detect the episode (currently, it marks the episode as to be downloaded)

	   I love this app and use it frequently. The only feature I would love to see is the ability to delete all downloaded podcasts. I tend to download a lot of podcasts over wifi so I can listen to them on long car rides, and it can be kind of a pain going through and deleting them all one by one.

	   A great free app with almost all the functions required from a podcasts app. Popular podcasts are easy to find and those that aren't can be added through the feed URL. My only gripe would be the lack of ability to scrub forwards and backwards 10-30 seconds within a podcast - otherwise a perfect 5/5!

	<comment>
	   Not the prettiest but certainly the most reliable podcatcher available on play store. The open podcast database it uses always finds what im looking for. I wish the automatic downloading had a bit more options and the podcast sorting was a bit more flexible but this is by far the most reliable and robust podcatcher ive tried. Others miss episodes or download in weird orders or at inappropriate times. That doesnt happen with antennapod. I highly recommend this outstanding app!

	<comment>
	   If you lose network connection at any time, such as due to a wifi deadspot, it won't only pause the podcast you're paying, even if it's pre downloaded, it will take full control of your phone abd lock out any and all actions. No home button, no volume control, no lock screen, etc. Until it either reconnect or times out (about thirty seconds). This is completely unacceptable, as a college student who walks around campus, and my internet will constantly go in and out.

	   Changed from an iPhone to android, so have limited experience of podcast apps. All I really want to do is find the podcasts I like, download, listen &amp; delete. I couldn't find the BBC casts I wanted without the URL, so I had to find the URL. I can't delete the episodes I've listened to, they just sit in the list. Maybe I'm just not using it right, but a few instructions would be welcome.

	<comment>
	   I love this podcast app, and have used it for quite some time. However, since the last update, it runs constantly in the background. I have changed the settings to update manually, but it still shows the icon in the task bar that it is syncing podcasts several times a day. I looked at the battery options in settings and this app is listed in the #2 spot for resource usage. Unfortunately, I am uninstalling it until this is fixed.

	   FOSS FTW. Works great. Been using it for 6 months. EDIT: Well it took me more than a month, but something between this app and Prestissimo was causing a CPU lock and up to 15%/hr battery drain. I've locked this app out of wake locks and from keep awake, uninstalled Prestissimo, and now I'm getting 1%/hr drain. Not sure where the fault is, but I'm not taking stars away as I could not do without this app.

	  I was looking for a podcast manager that requires minimal set-up and yet works the way you expect it to work. This one strikes an exceptionally good balance between simplicity and usefulness. Bonus points for open source and no ads. I like it so much I'm giving it 5 stars despite the occasional crashing.

	<title>Buggy</title>
	<comment>
	   I love supporting FOSS software, but this app has some flaws. It is a bit buggy. Sometimes pages and the menu turns all white as if the app is just a shell with no content. Other times, I will try searching for podcasts by category only to get a 404 error.

	   This is the greatest free podcast app I have found for downloading and playing podcasts offline. Version 0.9.9.2 crashes on all my devices when a video is played. I had to manually download and install the previous version 0.9.9.1.

	   This podcast manager is very well designed and executed. The interface is clear and clutter free yet also fully featured. The memory footprint is fairly minimal compared to other podcast managers. Stylish, simple and most importantly open source: this is one of the best android apps going.

	   While this app is still in beta, the interface is beautiful, works well, and it seamlessly imported opml from doggcatcher. I've paid for doggcatcher, tried pocketcasts and beyondpod, and this is the best I've ever used. Still needs to save podcast position when closed and the app is killed.

	<comment>
	   This app has been getting better and better, but it's not quite where I'm thrilled with it. I haven't found another podcast app that I'm happier with, yet. The new UI feels a little more intuitive, but the ability to add an episode to queue now takes too many clicks - I generally want to add to queue instead of download, so the big download button doesn't do it for me and instead is a waste of space!

	   This app has a good, clean interface that makes it simple to add feeds and just listen to what I want. It can be a little buggy at times (have never successfully completed a download, even on a solid connection), and the new UI could use as little refinement, but overall it does the job.

	<title>New version has some big drawbacks</title>
	<comment>
	   Two major things were good with the previous UI and are bad in the new one: 1. There's no way to tell the length of a podcast in the queue before you start playing it. There's not even a file size indication. For my usage this is a big negative, add I'm planning my choice of episodes based on the time available. 2. The pop-up window showing episode details now spans almost the entire screen, leaving a very narrow area to touch in order to leave it, effectively forcing me to use the "back" button.

	<comment>
	   I really like the simplicity. Popular apps like Podcast Addict and Podcast Republic display often useless information, like "last time podcast was checked for updates". All podcast apps always check for updates when you run them, so that's just clutter. It feel like I have to go 5 menus deep to do basic tasks with the others, and 3 menus is a "bad" as it gets with antenna pod. The one place I would offer criticism however: searching for podcast should be default, with an option to use the other methods.

	   New UI looks good. But where are "enquire all new" and "download all" buttons? Do I have to enqueue each episode one by one (it's now 4 clicks for each of them)? And why did you hide length of episode?

	<title>New UI Far Less Intuitive and Generates Lockups</title>
	<comment>
	   The new UI is significantly worse than the pre-May 31 interface. With the old interface it was easy to see the organization of podcasts. The new interface destroyed that view, making it hard to find what I want to listen to. But the biggest problem is that the new update seems to lock up my phone for no reason. I have had to pull the battery twice today in order to get my phone working again. For me, this is a real disaster. If not fixed soon, I'll move on to a different podcast manager.

	<comment>
	   This is still a decent podcast aggregate, but the new UI is a step backwards. Being able to see all of the titles subscribed to, then click into each and see the available episodes was very good - I can't seem to do that anymore. I'm still using this app, but it's a bit fiddly now.

	   I love this app and it has a ton of awesome features for a free app. However the new UI is taking some getting used to. I don't dislike the new UI, but I miss seeing the times of the episodes in the queue. I used to organize my queue from shortest to longest, but now I cannot easily see the length of each episode.

	   But the lock screen widget is nearly useless, searching takes forever, and there's no setting to separate video from audio.

	   So it works reasonably, but it doesn't auto download, takes a full minute to start, and doesn't quit so it drags down my battery. Just can't tolerate the challenges anymore.

	  Best podcast player I've been able to find on Android. It's excellent functionality-wise, but have potential for improvement in the interface design. A big plus for being open source as well!

	   Podcasts are efficiently downloaded, hassle-free. No obtrusive ads either. I like the fact that downloads can be saved to the external sd card. If you create an account with gpodder, all podcasts subscriptions can be synchronized to the cloud. Then on another device, simply download and install the opml file in your favorite podcatcher to have the same podcasts.

	   Am I misunderstanding how to use the app, or is the search completely broken? I try typing the names of lots of popular podcasts into the search, but it finds nothing. "No results were found". So unfortunately I can't try this app any further.

	<comment>
	   ***Request: portrait video support.***This is closest thing to gpodder for Android that I could find. It doesn't have too many options and it WORKS (for the most part). The only issue I have with the app is that it doesn't download youtube podcasts. I imported my opml from gpodder and my youtube feeds work there, so that is really the only issue I have with this app. It is still great t be able to download my podcast straight to my phone though. Thanks for a great app.

	<comment>
	   I read good things about AntennaPod while researching alternatives to the long in the tooth BeyondPod. However, the search feature is slow and littered with multiple listings for individual podcasts, most of which are out of date. That's if you're lucky enough for it to provide results at all. I never managed to get a feed added so I can't comment on its functionality as a player.

	<comment>
	   This application is extremely basic - which is not necessarily a 'bad' thing. It just doesn't seem to perform those basics well, e.g. when I have paused a podcast and returned at a later time...I don't currently see a way to start it again. There is no 'play' button, and the only available option is 'skip.' It also won't let me delete a podcast in mid-play unless I 'skip' it.

	<comment>
	   Das letzte Update (29.3.) muss gefixt werden. Kann meine Feeds nicht mehr aktualisieren weil die App f眉r jeden einzelnen Podcasteintrag ein Bild herunterladen will. Das sind bei meinen 25 Feeds 1500+ Bildchen die zwar meist (wie es auch sein sollte) nur ein paar kB, teilweise jedoch mehrere MB gro脽 sind. Ich verstehe dass das nett in der Feedansicht aussieht, aber das ist mir weder mein Speicherplatz wert noch die Zeit die meine kl盲gliche 2000er Leitung braucht um das zu ziehen.

Would love a distinction between episodes listened to (old) and else(new/DL'd). also:I'm traveling w/o access to wifi/3g, so my phone is connected via reverse tether so no-go. Please use usual methods of network detection. :-( Thx!

	   This is a very promising podcast player, even in beta, and it is open source, awesome! I feel it could stand some improvements in simplifying the UI, and some things can be a bit hidden. The queue system is also a bit unintuitive to me, I would much prefer just a simple list of recent podcasts ordered by date, an option to do this would be amazing. Icing on the cake would be a way to favourite episodes. Great work though devs!

	<comment>
	   I'm changing my review because my only complaint (podcasts being sorted by downloaded date instead of published date) has a good workaround. The feature of being able to re-order the episodes manually actually works better for me than any purely automated sort would. Plus, since my review, a second podcast directory was added to the "Add Podcast" screen, which makes finding new content even easier.

	   Could be great but still feels incomplete. No downloading progress in status bar. Seems to have weird bugs for example I was downloading an episode but didn't know if it was actually downloading as I couldn't see a progress bar so I tapped the download again and then when I found the download section it was downloading the episode twice. Surely the app would know that episode is already downloading and wouldn't download again.

	   1) no way to know what you've listened to. 2) no auto delete when you've finished a pod, which is another reason it's hard to know what you've already listened to. 3) very unintuitive.

Checking a file as read or unread is extremely erratic. Files are not automatically checked as unread so you have to manually check them. Then th

	   Moved to this from PodKicker +WiFi integration seamless, updates podcasts smoothly when I log in - updates across mobile network not turned on by default. +Search for podcasts straightforward - maybe more obscure would be tricky but I found all of mine no snags +All prog info, artwork downloaded +can set podcast download folder to SD card and not bung up phone memory -Queue not intuitive but I found a ref on the web and have now realised how to drag/drop into order . -All downloads are automatically added to the queue so it is a long list some way of sorting it would be a good idea -documentation skimpy to say the least, but then it is beta and free! -does not automatically delete listened to podcasts (but they go off queue) which is surprising as most podcast apps do this, some housekeeping functions seems overdue Usable in current state with clear development potential. If you are happy to play around and look online for info it is a good option. I will not be returning to podkicker

	   Hands down best podcast app. Good design and easy to use. Does seem to use a fair amount of battery during playback (high media server battery use) but that could probably be fixed with an update to use kitkat's newer audio tunneling feature.

	<comment>
	   Installed and opened with no errors, so that's worth 2 stars. When subscribing, instead of having "groups" of podcasts (with all the TWiT or 5by5 ones listed together for example) I had to scroll thru vague categories with long lists of pods and never did find find what I was looking for. Didn't see a way to search alphabetically either so uninstalled without subscribing to anything.

	   The hardest part is getting your podcast feeds entered, as its browser feature is pretty sad. But after you've got the feeds in, you are ready to roll. I've decided to upgrade to BeyondPod, but AntennaPod was a good starter app.

	   Free, no ads, no unnecessary permissions, clean interface, all the basic functions, open source, what more could you want? I tried a number of podcast apps and this is the one that's left. Truth be told, I did want one more function so I added Prestissimo, also free and open source, which allows you to speed up playback.

	   AntennaPod is a great FOSS podcast player. Been using it for a while now and have enjoyed the experience, for the most part. Some things that need improvement: Ability to skip ahead or back by 30 seconds (or some other interval, configurable preferable). Improve the widget. It's really basic and I'd like to see the Artwork displayed and it too often doesn't let me play a podcast I paused listening to. Search is lacking. I have a hard time finding podcasts on it that have been on the Web for years.

	   A good podcast app but it to have the option to have less than 10 episodes in the cache, at Max I only need 3, some podcasts are 100MB, so to have 10 episodes is a GB! Have a few podcasts and that is many GBs eaten up by podcasts... please fix that setting!

	   Works great, and has a simple, yet elegant interface. I only have 2 complaints: a) the "search for podcasts" feature sucks. I had to add all my feeds manually via copy&amp;paste because it didn't find anything. Not even mainstream stuff like hardcore history or radio lab! b) a "delete all played podcasts" button would be nice to have.

	<comment>
	   It's nice looking, easy to use, has great list management and automation options. If I had to deduct points, it would be for an occasionally inconsistent UI; with main functions buried in context menus, leading to some strangeness like not being able to play a podcast you've downloaded unless you go back to list view. Overall though, best podcast app available for the platform.

It was my favorite from the start, but what made me post this review is that the developer just added the option to change the playback speed of the podcast. It took this from a good app to an AWESOME app. Five stars, keep it up.

	  Best Google Listen replacement, free and open source, thriving communitytI have used Google Listen from when I got my Android phone to when the Google Reader service was discontinued. I tried BeyondPod and AntennaPod before the service ended and decided to stick with AntennaPod. They are both good, but I thought AntennaPod was a better Google Reader replacement. But maybe the fact that it is free and open source, has a thriving community on GitHub, and does not cost you a penny made me biased. See for yourself!

	   Some errors when downloading but usually spot on. would benefit from a sync function that shared podcast libraries between platforms such as phone and PC as adding/updating each can be a pain. the "add podcast" function is also very limited. in short a really good app with room to develop further.

	   The only reason I was able to come across this app was because of it's open-source credentials (found it on F-Droid, but downloaded it from here.) It's a perfect replacement to Google Listen, with improvements in all the areas Listen was lacking. Hopefully 5 star ratings will start helping this app show up more quickly amongst all the bloated pay apps.

	   The devs have done themselves proud with this app. It's a masterful piece of programming and a real delight to use. Browsing my favourite podcasts was never so intuitive or fun! Ok... just intuitive.

	   Second time I tried switching to AntennaPod from DoggCatcher, but search is still not working. Searching even generic terms turns up no results, such as "games", "tech" etc. Also, not sure what the "Miro Guide" is but clicking on it gives me an error "No peer certificate".

	   It would be great if there was any account associated with the app so I can sync my podcast across multiple devices... Option to delete certain episodes would be nice... Some sort of an indicator to mark already listened to podcast/episodes would be good thing to have... For now 3 stars...

	   This is an outstanding app. I would love to see the widget worked on but I won't hold that against it in my rating. Widget ideas: when new podcasts are queued, recognize them. Don't say no media playing. Offer a skip button.

	   I downloaded this weeks ago, but have only just started using it, and it is amazing. Pics the feed up easily, updates, awesome ui, love it. BTW for the rooster teeth podcast and others is it possible to grab the link dump for the app? And also deleting podcasts? If you add those features I will change my rating to 5 stars.

	   I think it's great, but I really wish there was a help file of some sort. I'm just lost as to how I end up at random screens. I think I'm downloading something but then I find I was streaming it. It's auto downloading podcasts from weeks ago and not the current. And just when I think I understand the icons I find I'm off base. I typically just tap on buttons at random till my podcast starts playing,but at least it finally plays.

	<comment>
	   OPML import still requires copying of the OPML file to a specific folder (no browsing to the file for easy import) and searching is turrible (!) but other than that, this app is one function away from becoming my no. 1 podcast app. The one thing: I need a feed for 'new' podcasts (see podkicker). Right now, going podcast by podcast to look for new episodes is a little silly, and with searching being so bad I cannot give up podkicker. But.. I am a fan.

	   This is a sleek, functional, no frills app for listening to podcasts. The best part is how well it fits the aesthetic of AOSP ICS/JB. I like the automatic downloads but from what I've seen there's no automatic cleanup (deletion of old items).

	<title>Clean interface</title>
	<comment>
	   I like the interface and look of this podcast player a lot, and the fact that it has some lockscreen controls is a huge plus for it. In terms of what I'd like to see improved, there are a few things. First, an easier way to add podcasts would be nice, like some kind of directory to search through. I had to add This American Life by pasting in the URL rather than using a search or selection activity. Second, adding fast-forward and rewind to the lockscreen would be good. Third, selection of items is a little clunky, and it takes too many clicks to perform operations on items in the list. One should be able to mark something unread in two clicks, but it takes three because the menu doesn't pop up automatically after selection. Fourth, marking things read/unread, adding and removing to the queue, and managing the downloaded/not downloaded statuses of all of the items isn't as easy as it could be. It's kind of a pain to have to separately manage all of these statuses independently. Also, auto-removal from the queue seems to work, but auto-removal from the device doesn't seem to work. And lastly, auto-downloading of items would be nice. Overall though, a great app!

	   I use this podcatcher every day and it's truly excellent. I've got no idea why people is giving it a 4. Some people even complain about things missing that actually is in the app. And if you think it can be better (because it always can be) don't rate it down, this is an open source project so you can contribute and collaborate to make it better for everyone.

	   I've bought a few others, but AntennaPod is my current favorite. The most glaring issue I can find at the moment is the inability to sort the play queue. Chrono, reverse, random, grouped by shows... these would be good options, for starters.

	   Very straightforward app, and I mean that as the biggest compliment. I searched forever for a decent podcast app and I found this one by chance only.

	   This is by far the best designed podcast app on the market; however, it is an absolute horror to have to add each feed by searching for feed URLs. I love the design and how quickly everything loads, but the search function needs to be improved exponentially. Besides that, this app is great!

	   Very nice and polished UI. Sadly it doesn't support auto download on WiFi or at least distinguish between new and new-downloaded in the feeds view. Would be 5 stars if it did.

	<comment>
	   This is a nice, clean, simple app for podcasts. My only request to the dev would be to make it so the podcasts pause when the headphones are removed. I use this for my drive to work and would like to be able to just unplug and go.

	   But lack of day/time feed scheduling is a big drawback. You can tell it to check every x hours but not to download at specific hours of the day.

	   1. Even though mobile data update is off, this app used 500 mb of my data plan! This is unacceptable. 2. Looks good, but battery consumption is huge.

	   I used to use Pocket Casts, but downloaded this to give it a try. So far, so good. Some things to note: * Auto refresh seems broken. * Can't search for or specify an OPML file for import. Must put it in a specific folder. * Can't specify a time to refresh. * UI is very clean and easy to navigate. I love the dark theme!

	   Love your podcast client! Only 2 things I would change is to make it easier to import opml files to maybe the download folder or show up when I click on the file along side other podcast clients and auto download. I love the HoloUI though.. It makes this stand out from the rest!

	<comment>
	   This app lacks some of the features of the better known podcasting apps, but it's early in development and it's very good at the things that it does. Also a very clean, holo theme interface which is nice. The only podcasting app that looks better is Pocket Casts, but that app has been unreliable downloading podcast episodes for me lately so I've been using AntennaPod as my daily podcast listening app.

	<comment>
	   I've tried the majority of the podcast apps and online radio/streaming apps available. None really caught my attention until I discovered AntennaPod. Open source and Holo themed? Heck yes! It's (currently) very basic, but it gets the job done and that's what counts. It downloads and/or streams and plays podcast feeds. As basic as you can get. The only area where I would say it needs improvement (and I foresee this being addressed eventually in a future update) is regarding searching/browsing for podcasts feeds. The "Browse Miro Guide" is rather limited and for people unfamiliar with manually adding feeds this will prevent them from easily finding the majority of the more popular podcast out there.

	<comment>
	   For so long I was tortured by Pocket Casts and other awful, pre-gingerbread apps. Thanks for the rescue! Gorgeous interface, fantastic playback, great integration, OPML import. Only feature I could think of would be a fixed time (e. g. 3am) to start the downloads. However, it's open source, so I guess I could do this myself. :)

	   The app is very cleanly designed and follows the new Holo app design guidelines nicely. The user experience could be refined a bit in places but its a new app that will likely be refined over time. Could also use improved search functionality for discovering new content.

	   Lots of potential. Download speed can be improved, but still acceptable. Features are adequate enough; though I would like some way to organise the feeds (or at least order it). Until then, I'll be sticking to BeyondPod, but I'm gonna keep my eyes peeled for updates.

	<comment>
	   First thing out of the box, OPML Import wants some arcane directory and filename. Why no file picker? Not a good first impression. Even worse, once I imported feeds, it became obvious this thing is almost useless. No auto download of newest episodes, no options on a per feed basis of how many episodes to keep, etc. I do not have the time to manually download and queue everything. All the "basic" functions I expect of a podcatcher, no it doesn't have that. Too simple to be of much use. Back to doggcatcher. It may be ugly but it works.

	   Has a few bugs but it's far better than any other podcast app I've tried. Only really major issue is that adding episodes with the search function does work well. This isn't that big an issue unless you have lots of podcasts since you can just paste in the RSS URLs.

	   Ui is good once you set it up. One thing it needs is a better search engine for podcasts. This is a little hard to come since they have to create a store like google play. What the developer can do is have a recommendation page with rising and barely heard of podcasts.

But to be clear I've bought both beyondpod and dogcatcher this is now my preferred podcasting app..

	   Quite good, not as good as the expensive BeyondPod but has all the basic right. Helps if you just copy past feed urls in, doesn't look so good if you don't already know what you want or can import. Hopefully it will be a popular open source project and we'll see many enhancements.

	<comment>
	   This app looks fantastic but really lacks in ease of setup. I installed and clicked the button to add a podcast and my only options were to input the URL, browse by category with very limited entries or import an opml list. So I went to my other podcast player and exported the list then when I tried to import it I was told it needed to be in some weird directory 5 levels down instead of letting choose the file I wanted. Once I got it set up it worked really well. I don't look forward to adding new podcasts.

	   To import and OPML file you have to copy it into a specific (and rather obscure) directory. Tried wrestling with my file manager for a while, then realised that it wasn't worth the effort. A simple browse option would have saved me some stress. May check back in a few months and see if it's more use friendly.

	   Been desperately searching for an app that follows the holo guidelines and is a worthy follow up to Google Listen in terms of simplicity. This app nails it.

	<title>Great app, but one key feature is missing.</title>
	<comment>
	   The ability to sync feeds and read counts across multiple devices would make this app a 5-star winner.

	   Needs expandable notifications for Jelly Bean devices and notification playback controls for ICS+. Other than that, very pretty app that follows Holo guidelines

	   Good and beautiful! Some pointers: Search is a little thin, only found 50% of the podcasts i listen to. It should start playing when tapping an episode in the episode list and would also be great to mark episodes as listened. I'm going for this player, best so far!

	   This is one of the best podcast apps hands down. Very nice, clean, and appealing UI. It functions just like it's supposed to and gives the listener the option to either download or stream. Only problem with it is the Miro Guide, it has a small selection but if you can't find what you're looking for just go to the Miro website and find your selections URL and you're set.

	   No bugs what so ever and it's free too. Took me a bit of time to work out the feed URLs using Google search and type it in, but overall an extremely polished podcaster.

	<title>Cool App</title>
	<comment>
	   This is by far the best looking free podcast app I've found. The interface is pretty minimal, but it has pretty much every feature I'm interested in. Another thing I really like is that it doesn't require a million seeming unrelated permissions like the more popular podcast apps do. Definitely worth checking out now that Google has discontinued Listen.

	   I wanted to like this app a lot, as it looks good and is minimalistic In a good way. However, I did have problems with one feed, but another worked well. It's worth giving it a shot.
