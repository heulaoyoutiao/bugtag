	  UPDATED: Fantastic client and my default for many years. 5.203 has two big problems. Messages load slow, real slow. And the attachment is now indicated at the bottom of the message not at the top. So you can easily miss it. This is a deal breaker for a default email client. THANKS FOR FIXING THIS: The last two updates (this year) broke message reply. I use dark theme. In the reply window, the message I'm replying to is now either light theme or most appears blank. In the past it would be visible in the dark theme. The part where I'm writing is still dark theme. Please fix. Thanks.

	  This a very easy to use app. I have had no problems using it and haven't noticed any glitches or bugs. It's a great alternative to Google's email client that comes with Android, for those of you who are concerned about privacy online. I love the fact that it's open source but I don't know if the code has been thoroughly audited. Having said that I still highly recommend over a proprietary email client.

	  I've been usinh this since the start, but the last update really need some fixing ASAP!! The attachment need to go back to the TOP not bottom, why would anyone wants to scroll all the way down just to view the attachment? Second, the loading takes more time just to read email.

	  Was the best email app I know for Android, and I've used a few. But since v5.xx it goes worse and worse every time. Latest 5.02 version broke email viewing. Plus zooming. Absurd how it's even tested. Being free doesn't mean of low quality, but lately K9 email means exactly that.

	  Great app ... have been using it for years, however with Marshmallow 6.0.1 at least twice a day I get this message in the app interface "syncing is disabled". This affects me greatly and there isn't any pattern to when this disabling of syncing takes place. This means I can at best give 3 stars rather than the 5 star rating I felt was deserved on operating systems before Android 6.

	  Great email app- been using it for ages. Two minor issues I have: one, I'm *constantly* accidentally dragging the scrollbar in the messages list. I don't have this issue in other apps so it seems the behavior could be better. Second, in the recent update, when reading an email with an attachment, you have to scroll all the way to the bottom to see the attachments. Used to you could access them easily from the top. Hope to see this change reverted. Thanks

	  I had used k9 for many years as there wasn't another email client nearly half as good or efficient, but the latest update has introduced a number changes that make it significantly slower to use. Bring back the "mark all read" in notification pull down, and let us disable warnings such as confirmation required to"mark all read" in main window. I think these two things will cost me half an hour a day managing my email on the go, that is 3 weeks in a year, I will check back in a few months if these are back. Update 5023 improved and fixed a few things, notification area still needs work, it's hard work trying to get the right message to show the options so you can delete or mark read when each has its own set of options and even Gmail doesn't split the options or message, change for the sake rather than good functional design, thanks for listening on the other things though.

	  Used to be the best mail app I used but the latest update has changed how notifications work. Instead of going straight to an account's inbox it just goes to a list of folders instead which means an extra tap... An option would have been great for any UI changes. Reading mail was a lot quicker before this. Also, emptying trash doesn't free up space any more. Either numbers not updating or it's really not being freed. Some aesthetic update wouldn't hurt like some icons.

	  Add the ability to mark all read without a confirmation prompt and I'll add the two missing stars. Why this was removed in the first place is beyond me. As promised, the ability to mark all read without a confirmation prompt is back and this is once again a 5 star app.

	  After last update it is almost impossible to zoom in/out. When it won't let you zoom out, the emails can't be read and this app becomes useless. Some messages won't allow either to happen even though I was able to with previous versions.

	  I use it for few years already. App eating my battery in 8 hours. The problem was with trash folder. Probably bad index after the update. It was impossible to just empy the trash. I delete few of them and finally was able to emty the folder. Developers tolerate deleting more than marking all messages as read. User can disable question for deleting, but not for marking them as read.:-? I use it as last operation after read some messages. The rest is ok with just reading the subject.

	  I like this app. My only gripe is the design, looks a little dated although still functions as good as ever.

	  used to be my favorite apps, but since last update i've got lost all my starred email from my inbox and unable to find it in any folder. It just dissapear. The only option to get it back is to resend those emails from another device or create new email account and search it one by one from my thousands mails and it will happen again soon

	  Pinch to zoom isn't working. Can zoom in using expanding two fingers but then can't scroll to view all parts of the email and can't pinch to re-shrink the email. Moto G4 Plus.

	  Best EMail Reader for FREE. Able to backup, migrate and restore settings - the most important thing compared to in-built email readers or even Microsoft Outlook or Google's own GMail client. However, latest update forces attachments to appear at the bottom - and a long email chain forces you to scroll forever to get to the bottom (and finally the attachment). Rule no 1 of UI change design: if you change it, make sure it's configurable to allow users choice!

	  Thank you for such a terrific free app. The latest version has lots of cool features. May I suggest some features/fixes? A setting to allow attachment list to appear on top or below message body. Last update moved it to the bottom where they can be missed. Make confirm optional on 'mark all messages as read'. Searches on a large database makes screen go black for a few seconds and then crashes on longer search strings. 'Delete message' from home task list deletes message but dialog box can remain.

	  I used to absolutely love the K-9 mail app, but now it's nothing more than a frustration. No matter what settings I change, it continues to turn off syncing. Sometimes rebooting my phone will fix the problem for a short period of time, but most of the time I have to sync my mail manually. I've read all the comments on forums from other people experiencing the same problem and tried everything they suggested. Nothing changes. I really hope they are working on the problem for a future update. If it doesn't get fixed soon, I'm going to have to switch to another mail app. By the way, I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 4 with Android version 6.0.1. The version of K-9 Mail I have is 5.202

	   Too bad. K-9 used to be great but now it's glitchy, sluggish and looks and feels outdated. My Gmail accounts stop working (login authorization problem) when switching between WiFi and 4G. Yes, K-9 is rich with features but it's still awkward to use. It's just too annoying to deal with. Back too MailDroid, which is much more stable and easier to get around in...

	   Last 2 upgrades have wiped out all saved and deleted emails. Other than screen printing not much of a way to save one external to the program. Not good when you might need hotel and travel confirmations not to mention event tickets. You can exclude a program in Play updates without doing each individually so dumping the program

	<comment>
	   I have added an email account that I don't have access to anymore, but I'd still like to have the emails available. Therefor I changed the account settings to never poll the server. Since the last update this doesn't seem to work anymore. I am constantly reminded that the authentication failed. Can you fix this please?...still not fixed after last update. Will give it 5 star when problem is removed.

	<title>Freezes and crashes incessantly, and sometimes eats messages in composition</title>
	<comment>
	   I have been using K-9 Mail for over 2 years due to being stuck with POP3 service on Verizon, and K-9 Mail has increasingly tended to freeze up and sometimes crash; after the update to the latest version available on January 3, 2017, it stopped working entirely. It also sometimes loses messages in composition without saving a Draft. Switched to Blue Mail, which is missing some features important for POP3, but at least works.

	   Hard to believe that this is rated slightly lower than K@Mail Pro. Pretty close to same. A few things better. For example you can choose to include or exclude an account from the group in box. If I had to do it again, I would save my money and use K-9. Only down side of K-9 is an ugly icon. I can live with that!

	   The last 2 updates have a problem not clearing the mail icon from the andriod taskbar when the emails are read, and after the email is read and i select the mail icon from the taskbar i get an error. Its also slower to remove the number of new mail from the desktop shortcut. Galaxy S5 UPDATE: this app is becoming useless as it is not deleting or marking messages as read, i select a bunch of messages and delete them and a short while later i get the same messages back again as if i haven't seen them before.

	   Almost. One pinch of salt is that Google and Yahoo require you to allow "unsafe application access" before using K-9. Other than that, I adore the night mode & color marking by the arrival addres. Haven't run into trouble with it yet

	   5 stars prior to latest version - now 2 stars. The latest version introduced many bugs. You can no longer zoom text. Delete a message causes app to crash. Scroll to previous message causes crash. It seems to always end abruptly. There are probably more problems, but I don't want look for them.

	<comment>
	   Was working fine but now it only sometimes updates the inbox with new emails after polling and pinch to zoom doesn't work properly any more. It really only now works on text only emails. Very disappointing.

	<comment>
	   The new version is noticeably slower than previous versions. It lags on button clicks, and message text now fades in slowly. This is with gaudy effects turned off. However it's still the best available android imap email client.

	   Please let me disable the pop up asking if I'm sure that I want to mark all messages as read... You have options to disable confirmation of other actions, and now you add a new one, annoying as hell and don't give us the option to disable it... Great work QA team...

	<comment>
	   I use K-9 because it's the only email app that leaves my Gmail messages "unread" on the server after I open them on my phone. This sudden inability to zoom is rendering that pointless if I can't read the messages on my phone. Please fix ASAP

	<title>Love K-9... 5.202 release has zoom and Autowrap bugs</title>
	<comment>
	   Version 5.202 has no way of zooming into an email. After using an earlier version of K-9 for about a year, I replaced my S4 with S7 after damage. The New K-9 ver. 4.803 does not have a way to auto wrap an email after zooming and increasing font size. Once you double tap, the old ver auto wrapped the text. 4.803 version just zooms in and out. This is key to my productivity reading emails as now I need scroll rightand leftafter zoomingto read.... and this should be fixed by the developers ASAP

	<comment>
	   Poor 5.201 update, let me disable the confirmation to mark all mail as read, please take the training wheels off the bike! When you add a feature take a look at how other features are integrated and match it. This provides a much more predictable ui. Similar features should provide similar options. Reverting to previous build. May the requestor for this feature forever be bombarded with pop ups to confirm every action ;-) ps would appreciate zoom back. Move attachments back up like every other email app!

	  Latest update is hopeless. Now can't send emails from one of my accounts - UPDATE: fixed by recreating accounts, every folder had to be recreated. The new Send screen is of poor design with the contacts taking up too much room. The app now crashes every so often, didn't happen before. Very disappointed.

	   The pinch zoom has stopped working now after new app update. Why spoil this function when it was working fine before. Also problems logging in to IMAP mail now using SSL/TSL security which I never had on previous releases. If k9 works ok before then don't fix it and mess it up!

	   The latest updates have ruined this once-great app! It crashes, force-closes, and when I reply to messages all the text that I am replying to is a dark blue and cannot be seen. I even downloaded earlier versions to install, but V5.0 which 'might' fix the problem fails to see my import back-up file. So until it's fixed, we're all just stuck. WHY update an app that was working?! I'm a long-time user, but will have to switch apps if this isn't fixed.

	   Tons of certificate errors on outgoing server since update. I really wish the app didn't have to download a set number of messages. If I delete a new email why do really old emails reappear so I have to mark them read - again, and again, and again? this isn't required for Yahoo mail just my POP.

	<comment>
	   In Accounts when you select an individual account options pop up. I used to select "clear messages" to remove all local messages, since 2 updates ago this has ceased to work on both my phone and tablet. Appears to do so but size does not reduce. Tried to find link from K9 its self to report but end up with host Github. It would be good to be able to report errors from app without spoiling feedback for this great app. Back to 5 stars when fixed.

	<title>Bad Change About Attachment At Bottom of Email</title>
	<comment>
	   I have been using K-9 mail for many years. Everything was good but the recent change of putting attachment to bottom of email is very disappointed (in the past, there was a button on top of email to see attachment). A lot of times, my daily email has long chain. After the recent change, I have to scroll the email to very bottom to get the attachment. It wastes time and it is a VERY BAD idea and VERY BAD change.

	   The only thing I can think to recommend at this point is for the app to "collect" addresses that have been entered TO/CC/BCC into its database (like an Outlook NK2 file) so that they will show up as "autocomplete" entries in future message dialogs -- without users having to go through the cumbersome process of adding email addresses as fully-qualified Android contacts

	   After last 2 update, I can't pinch zoom in and out? It is difficult to read without this functionality because I have reading glasses and sometimes I reply on big text to quickly read without glasses. Secondly, why the attachments are down there now? It used to be beginning of msg. Now have to go all the way down to see. Unnecessary waste of minutes. Please correct both.

	<comment>
	   5 years ago I helped a coworker move over to K-9 when she had some problems with the built-in email app and a 3rd party mail server. It did a great job where the other failed and saved us all a lot of headaches. Fast forward to October 2015, when I got my first Android phone, and I'm facing a similar situation. Didn't take me long to remember K-9. I installed it on my phone and I haven't looked back. It does a great job and is very customizable. Thanks!

	<comment>
	   I have to admit, I was hesitant to take K-9 Mail for a spin because it's not much to look at and it didn't appear to offer anything particularly special... But whilst others may look pretty, I don't trust some of them as far as I can spit, so I decided to try-out K-9 Mail - and I'm glad I did! The everyday user will find that this is a fantastic e-mail client, while power users will be in heaven with the enormous amount of options and settings readily available... Battery usage could be improved though.

	<title>External sdcard email data storage does not work on Samsung Galaxy J3</title>
	<comment>
	   I choosed storage "External", however all data are still being stored on local storage. Maybe it would be best solutin to let user to choose exactly folder where email data would be stored. My local storage has capacity 4gb only and with all apps installed included emails my free space is cca 300mb - result is that whenever i want to update any app, i have to do cleaning cache and other data. Installing k-9 app on local storage is off course OK. The concern is email data only. Anyway, very good email client

	  A complete and mature email client, the best offered in play store, never had issues with it. Developers please consider making k9mail for windows PC!

	<comment>
	   I've been using K-9 for years and loved it. Unfortunately the latest releases (5.1 and up) are so full of bugs and annoying/unnecessary UI changes that it's become unusable. I don't know what new programmers or philosophy you now have but you've managed to take what was probably the best Android email client and destroyed it. Luckily I was able to downgrade to an older version and will use it for the time being until I have to find something else. For those out there who haven't upgraded yet DON'T!

	<comment>
	   Like many have noted, the latest update appears broken. Main issues, for me, are account sizes now showing arbitrary large values even when completely empty & that the app now appears randomly laggy. In particular, zooming & panning are often unresponsive & are very erratic when they do respond. Shouldn't be like this in current phones like Samsung Galaxy S7. Really liked this app, so please roll back & fix issues in meantime. Looking forward to giving its 5 stars back.

	<comment>
	   I loved this app for many years on different phones, because it's different. I don't like Gmail. Last update simply makes me evaluate other apps. So many changes it's not K9 anymore. Now you can't even change the displayed names of contacts, I don't want to send mgs with the name on contact list. But worse you can't see text on msg if it considers is a thread msg, even when threaded view is off. Please give us back the older version

	   Roll back the update, until you have a working release. This is pretty unacceptable. If I don't see a fix or some sort of announcement indicating you are working on a fix, I'm done with this app. Worked fine for years. Now it's useless and I am most worried I have lost information I keep no where else. Shame on me for that. But greater shame on you. I'll never fully trust your app again.

	   I hoped to be able to use an open source email client. Unfortunately it's not good enough. Push notifications are glitchy, poll syncing stops randomly, there are no swipe gestures, menus and notification actions aren't configurable. Apps like BlueMail and AquaMail are much better.

	  Most regretful update! I have used this app for many years. So far so good until the recent two updates that failed the authentication check. Worse-still, after retrying, it ended up having one of my email accounts blocked as if it's hijacked. This happened on all my devices so I believe it's not device- or os- specific, and I believe mine is not an isolated case. I am going to uninstall this irresponsible app for good.

	   It was working really well until the last update, now I can no longer send or receive mail and get connection errors. From the number of reviewers complaining I'm not the only one, if I were K9 I'd roll back the release before everyone moves on.

	   This handles email well enough. With the latest update, suddenly the size of the database has grown tremendously even when all messages are deleted and the account is compacted. Was a 4 star, now at 2. So it's rated at 3 by me.

	  This app is very nice, but still misses one feature, may be you can consider this for future releases. It will be very good to have the possibility to change the poll frequency depending on time, something like in samsung mail client top hours (working hours) - once in 3 min, during normal time once in half an hour (the polling time are just examples). Now it is possible to set the polling time only globally not depending on time frame. Thanks, and good job!

	  Worked really great for years, but the last update (January 2017) broke the auto syncing. In my accounts folder the header says "Sync is disabled" and I have to manually sync now. PLEASE FIX THIS, it has only started doing this with the latest update and makes k9 essentially useless.

	  Have loved the app in the past, but last update broke some important things. This is on my Samsung 12.1 tablet. First, it no longer displays the subject line above the current message, now just the send and receive addresses. Second, zooming in and scrolling in an email is broken. Would love to go back to a 5 star review, hopefully a (tested) fix is coming soon.

	   First off, it's open source and you can build your own app from source files hosted on GitHub. Secondly, its a 'proper' email client with non of the useless bells and whistles you see on other email clients (looking at you Gmail). Lastly, as of version 5.2, it now supports PGP/MIME (need the OpenKeyChain). Gets better with each update.

	   Brilliant mail app that ahead of its time lord. A small issue with the favourites starin the message list. It is placed over the message list slide so when you try to select the star the app moves the message list down the page. Forcing me to go into each message to add the star. Would be great if you could move the star over to the left side under the multi select boxes so they can be used in the same manner to avoid this frustration. Each a bit bigger would also be great for easier selection problems.

	   Secure. Security is priority in my book and for now this App meets the requirements. Other high rated Apps like Aqua mail have analytics in their App. Blue Mail another high rated App has loop hole where your mail passes and can be held on their mail server. K9 mail is open source which means it can be inspected for security risk. Reviews on Internet show it to be safe and secure across the board. Not the best of interfaces but worthy trade off for me. It's free and secure. Well done K9.Thx

	   Don't need the extensive list of options per email with poor defaults. Got 12 emails, don't need hundreds of options needing changed. Let me set one default preset that all emails will adopt by default, just set a button to set email to default preset, then people can change few things they want to change, but make most their setting set to defaults they want easily

	<comment>
	   Update 5.20, in removing APG compatibility has destroyed a great app. APG allowed me to encrypt to ANY key. Openkeychain only allows encryption to registered aliases and 5.20 only allows ONE key to be set. PLEASE bring back APG option. Now have to use 5.01 from Fdroid.

	   Was great until the update caused Authentication failed notifications even when password reentered. Will put back to 5 stars when it's fixed as it really WAS a great app for multiple emails. Can save to SD card. Can set to auto sync or you can just manually check mail. Best I've found by far. Have been using it for ages now....until this rubbish update. If not fixed will delete. Please fix :)

	   2017 UPDATE (original review 2013) - For approx' 5 years I've used K9 as my main email client. The setup is still a problem, complete hit or miss. Hours are spent on forums trying to find the correct settings for accounts to work correctly. The auto settings used by the app simply do not access accounts (Yahoo!) correctly. The best app ONCE SETUP, but setup really makes this awful.

	  This is a great app. Have been using it for years. However with the last update, K9 keeps giving me (and my wife) authentication failed messages even when I re-enter passwords. I even tried changing passwords for two email accounts. The constant notifications are pretty annoying and have finally had to block k9 notifications. Is there a way to roll back to the previous update? I still give you five stars for outstanding work. Thanks.

	   I love the options to customize the look, the colors, dark theme. Have used for several months without one problem. I have several accounts and so easy to get all my messages in one app. UPDATE 12/3/16 I had to uninstall this app. It will only fetch and send emails for 2 out of 3 of my accounts. I downloaded a different email app and I get all my email. I wrote to the developer twice for assistance and got no reply.

	<comment>
	   Crashes trying to delete IMAP messages every time. Although It is the ONLY app I found capable of sorting messages and showing Internet headers, the reliability of some of these advanced function is only so-so for large numbers of messages (10k). Sorting by sender does not appear to work at all and sorting by date (sent) vs. received date only sort of worked. So overall a bit disappointing.

	  Loved this app but it suddenly started draining both data and battery. First warning was a text from my operator saying that I'd used 6GB mobile data in a couple of weeks last summer. Checked the phone and it was almost all down to K9. Disabled background data 鈥? hardly ideal 鈥? but I was prepared to give the program another chance. Final straw happened a few days ago when I experienced serious internet connectivity problems, only to discover that K9 Mail had used over 60GB of wifi data over the previous month. At the risk of stating the obvious, this is insane! Having persevered with this for years, I've now given up, uninstalled and gained about 3 hours battery life per day. Should be removed from the Play Store.

	   Keeps losing my settings. I filed a bug report and they ignored it. Also the settings import is broken, so I have to keep manually setting it up every few weeks. Very frustrating.

	   Not sure if it was a K-9 update or an android update, I dislike the very small window that pops up when you long press an email. You get 1 to 2 lines of text that you have to scroll to make your choice: select, delete, move, or whatever options there are. I used to see almost all the choices at once, that was better. I would rate higher otherwise.

	   You can't use the star on the right side to star a message, because you will hit the hitbox of the scrollbar and scroll to that position. Works neither in portrait nor in landscape mode :( besides that, the app is truly amazing !

	<comment>
	   Been using this for years but the time is right to move on. Just too poor and old. And it's starting to be a pain. Also, what's the point in spam folder when you can't mark things as spam? Could be a little more simple when setting up (like auto poll not working until background sync is set to always) but once sorted it's a good mail client (other than the above issues). But it's never going to evolve. Bye, was good to begin with.

	<comment>
	   K-9 mail shows what a team of motivated engineers can accomplish. It's Open Source, Versatile, Fast and runs on multiple Android versions. It is much better than the bloatware Gmail client which sucks up bandwidth and needs to be updated often. K-9 mail rocks ! Everyone of us in our team uses K-9 mail.

	<comment>
	   I have used K9 for years, since my Galaxy S1 and now on my Google Pixel with Android 7.1. I did notice sync randomly being disabled on the new device and found this is due to doze (battery save) in the kernel. Once I removed the app from doze it now works great as usual and with three accounts that sync at 5,10 and 30 minute intervals only uses about 6鈩? battery life in a 14 hour period. I actively use K9 throughout the day to send mail as well, usually large mail with pictures. Best by far of all clients.

	   Having tried many email clients, this replaced subs supported Profimail for me. Setup takes some getting used to and some areas could be improved but it is great and reliable. EDIT: three years later I still like it but I wish it used concurrent connections that would dramatically reduce delays. Also, forward as attachment would be good.

	<comment>
	   What happened to My gmail. I've been using this app for years because it gave me some accessibility with the dark mode but last week all my Gmail accounts are no longer downloading, just aol now. So I left and found BlueMail which now also has this accessibility dark mode. 4 days no email from google does any one even support this app anymore. YOU NEED TO FIX IT.

	<comment>
	   I've used this app for the last 6 years but over time the performance has declined. For the last several months I've had emails disappear, deleted emails reappear and now emails are not being pulled in from the server unless I refresh. Checked my settings and found no problems. It was good while it lasted. Uninstalling.

	   Initially worked, it rejected cert. but I accepted the cert having manually checked it with another site.Although could read mail it wouldn't autosync. Can't edit connection after initial setup as far as I can see so reinstalled having read that initially setting up over WiFi may have been the problem (!). Then wouldn't connect at all without WiFi. And wouldn't then connect with WiFi. Attempt to file bug, submit new issue button is greyed out after I type it all in. What a ** waste of my time.

	<comment>
	   Used it a few years ago. Went to Microsofts. Came back because of SD storage..used it for a week. The push notifications often don't come through Maybe only 80%. Outlook and Gmail 100%. Sometimes polling gets stuck and won't stop until you force it. No swiping features like outlook or gmail. I will try again in a year because I was SD storage due to phone space.

	   Sadly, the unified inbox feature more likely works as a "unified everything including trash" folder, which somehow defeats one of the reasons to have a separate email app (unless I missed something).

	   The app only checks for mail when I open it, which isn't very useful. Maybe it's caused by me being in China, but given that the mail server is in China also I fail to see why it doesn't work correctly.

	<title>Accessibility issues - fonts</title>
	<comment>
	   Devs: Only a set range of font sizes are available, which is a blemish on an otherwise awesome app. Font sizes all top out, sometimes at relatively low values. Example: composition view hits maximum at a font called "larger" which is about 2.5 mm on my device. Unlimited font scaling is available in some apps - would be good in K9 also. Fonts could be configurable at a percent value (ex: 250%), with no top-out or limit. Please look into it! Eye strain is becoming an epidemic.

	   This is one of the worst most complicated user-unfriendly apps I've ever tried. I don't care how secure and powerful it is. It's a pain and I immediately uninstall it every time I try it. Play along with Google Apps, Gmail, and others and make it easier for people to set these up.

	   UPDATED 2016-10-21: On a Moto Z now, Android 6.0.1 and this is still my default email app since 1st time in 2012-06-14. It's a no nonsense, reliable and simple email app. Thanks developers!

	   Unfortunately the app no longer fetches email automatically, i have to go into the app and manually refresh each inbox to recieve mail. Since i need to be notified of emails as they come in, this makes the app useless to me. I'll reinstall once they fix this bug, but until then i cannot recommend this app.

	<comment>
	   Used for about two years. Three weeks ago sent email with improper address. Was rejected by system. Corrected address, then sent. Since then, notification comes every five minutes regarding "email failed to send." Annoying enough that I finally uninstalled today and will check out newer apps.

	   The UI might not be flashy but it is very efficient. Love the account color coding in unified inbox and "mark all as read" functionality. Account backup saves lot of time when I am migrating between devices. This little gem is one of the reasons why I am refusing to switch to iOS.

	  Decent app, but it always stops syncing randomly, then I have to open it, close it, open it, close it, then it says syncing is disabled(?) then I close it and open it again a few times and it starts resync'ing. Simply stopped working on Nougat. I never syncs until I manually open the app. Useless mail software. Time to move on to a competitor, this looks like abandonware.

However, right now it allow mail movement to another folders within the same email ID but it would be better if it allow mails to be able to move from different email ID. K9 team please consider as many folks out there believe is using more then I email ID

	   When the display is off for a couple of hours, push notifications aren't sent any more and a manual poll has to be done to resolve the issue. Update: Now, even manual polling gets stuck. Switched to GMX app where push works even after I get up in the morning. After using K-9 for so long, this seems like a miracle to me....

	<comment>
	   Despite wifi set to 'on' when my two devices sleep, and power saving set to automatic (3 days of no use before the app is not allowed to run in the background), sync turns off within an hour after both devices go to sleep. It can only be turned on by clearing the app out of memory and restarting it. Very annoying. It never did this under Android 5.x.

	   There are lots of issues, but the latest bug is in that when sending emails they often time out instantly and I get a "failed to send" notification in my notification bar and they remain in the outbox. Then when I open the outbox and select "send emails" from the drop down menu they get sent instantly.

	   The UI could be modernised as well. It appeals to the open source, PGP/GPG market, and that's why I still happily use the app! Just wish I could use all my accounts with it.

	   I needed rich text signature in order to use this app with my companies logo on every email. Not sure why this is such an alien feature. Every desktop client has rich text or html feature built into the signature. I hope someone will let me know if they upgrade the signature because I am a fan of all open source projects and would love to support this one.

	   For some reason today this has just stopped working. I've cleared my cache, now tried uninstalling and reinstalling but get so far in the setting up process and each time the app just crashes, over and over. Today I missed a very important email because of this, and STILL can't get it to work. Very unhappy.

	<comment>
	   Syncing correctly on Motorola phone, but as of a few weeks ago no longer displays notifications (they are switched on for the app and other apps all working fine). You don't put dates for your releases (!) so no idea when the app auto updated to 5 & if this is the reason. 2 stars for what should be 5. Please fix.

	<comment>
	   If you like to tweak and configure settings, K-9 is the best email app, hands down. E.g. ability to override phone sync settings is invaluable if you want to get your email notifications when you're out but not Facebook, Soundcloud, etc. Integration with APG for PGP email encryption is also really cool for serious nerd cred. 10/10 makes me want to move back into mom's basement.

	   The star is in the same place as the invisible scroll bar so 9 out of 10 times you'll hit the scroll bar instead of the star when you try. Otherwise, great software. Just not so good UI...

	   Constantly deletes emails. I will open up the app and 3-4 days of emails will be gone. I have to reinstall it to get the emails back. It's ridiculous. The only reason I keep it is because it holds more email than my server and I like the layout.

	   Use it on notoriously difficult Yahoo and it works like a laptop. Simply brilliant 10 stars.(actually it's easily the best piece of s/w I've installed) Unbelievably lightweight, fast, so good it's amazing. It pulls all pictures of contacts onto emails perfectly. I use it under an Apex Launcher system on top of android, which works well.

	  Great APP, Horrible widget For as long as I've been on Android, I've used K-9 email along with MailListWidget for K-9. For some reason, the MailListWidget is no longer available and I can't get it to install on my Note 7. So I now have no unread email list widget. Which means I'm using the standard Android email client. Why, after all these years have you not built a mail list widget?! I have always liked having a list of new emails listed right on my home screen and I could select the one I wanted to read. Now I have to open the client, hit each folder to find out what new emails I have. Love K-9, HATE the lack of widget support. Since K-9 doesn't meet my needs any more, I give it a 3 instead of the 5 I would give it on my Note 4 where the third party widget still worked. Wish K-9 had a native mail list widget.

	   Much more configuration options than mymail, better visually too, can be dark background everywhere. Wish this existed for desktop PC as well. I would prefer k9mail over Thunderbird anytime! Don't like the dog association, what does k9 have to do with email? Dogs are a huge waste of resources by the way. 8 billion humans weren't enough of a burden to our planet? But I digress.. Some complain about the interface being dated, but for me that's the reason it's the best app for email out there. Very efficient!

	<title>Best Email App For Multiple Accounts</title>
	<comment>
	   Best free one I've found for more than two email accounts. Good amount of customization and dark theme. Two requests: on LG V10 can't set a sepparate notification sound and can't add addresses to address book from inside the app.

	<comment>
	   Great email app with some very handy features like the unified list and multiple identities! Could be a little better if you could move etc multiple selected messages when in the unified list, change the from email address manually, and change the brightness of the account colour.

	<comment>
	   You can attach photos and rubbish but you cannot attach anything in any of your folders like a doc or a pdf... not on my android 4... so what is the problem... this is the most vital of features. Next you cant share to whatapp on android 4. You cant save to a different location... just stock location. You cant select some headings text on an email... why... because it is unselectable... why... only the programmer can say... if it cannot connect to your server it does not give you a warning... what !!.

	<title>Sub folder sync support</title>
	<comment>
	   Although mail usage is dominated by Gmail and Outlook, K-9 plays a very niche role. It allows user to configure the mail they would like it. So you can do things like subfolder sync, periodic notification (instead of relentless push). If you are a power user then you would really love it as the app completely moulds itself according to your preferences.

	   Mit K9-Mail bekommt man kostenlos was andere Email-Apps kostenpflichtig nicht schaffen! Alleine das Grundprogramm ist schon besser als die meisten Konkurrenten, und dazu gesellen sich noch einige (ebenfalls kostenlose) Erweiterungen mit denen man sich das Programm komplett nach eigenen W眉nschen anpassen kann!

	  K-9 Mail client is simply the best and the most versatile way of working with your inbox on the phone. I've been using it since 2009 on a number of Android devices and never had any issues with the app. Extremely fast, reliable and configurable, doesn't drain battery even with the frequent push-notifications enabled, has intuitive interface, and does exactly what it has to do. K-9 Mail is also smart enough to recognize necessary settings for the majority of ISPs, making the initial setup effortless. Thank you guys for this decent open-source software.

	   After trying so many e-mail apps, this is by far the best! If you have more than one e-mail account do yourself a favour and install this one. I need to juggle a half dozen accounts and the app handles it better than every other app I've tried. Good customization and ability to handle different accounts differently. I can set auto refresh to different times for each account, set different notifications, etc. I am impressed with this app, I have made this my primary e-mail over my PC based one.

It's that simple to describe it, nothing else to say, really, because it's just great! Last year, when I bought a new phone, i didn't even try its own mail client app because i got used to k9 a lot. Thanks for your great app and amazing support!

	   This classifies some of my emails as SPAM, so they miss my inbox!? Can't return the mail to my inbox - too much beating around the bush! Can't risk missing any important messages, so next step: TOTAL REMOVAL (uninstalling it, if that's your jargon).Gmail is a more reliable source, anyway. Thank God I still have it.

	<title>Newer Look Sucks, Older Versions More Intuitive</title>
	<comment>
	   I'm so glad I back up my apps! The latest versions of K9 have become so much like every other app - ugly, cumbersome, and space wasting - that there's basically no point choosing what was once an amazing app over something else. It's a true shame. However, I continue to use an awesome, older version with a very compact and intuitive interface. That version k9 remain my favourite email app, but I wouldn't bother suffering through the newer versions. (I tried, and hated the experience.)

	   You'll never use another email app. Simple, reliable and does everything you'll ever need. Sadly Google has decided it's not secure enough so they can force you onto Gmail app. This is just a Gmail con.

	   I love this app. The problems started after the last two upgrades. Now when you open an email and try to enlarge it, it just makes it larger than the screen width. It used to re adjust and keep the email screen width and made it longer. Is there a setting for this or is there a program error? July 13 2016. This app has quit functioning properly as of today. I can only get to my starred email list. The inbox is not accessible. Can this be fixed?

	<comment>
	   Great app all the way around. I'm sure there's probably more customizing I could do with it, but 2 email accounts + 2 Live accounts, not a big contact list to deal with, so I'm all good. Suggestion : make a delete action possible, the same as 'mark as read' or 'reply', in notification prompt as it should appear in Android Wear/Notification bar.

	<title>Near perfect Android mail client, but with issues since Android 5 and 6</title>
	<comment>
	   It's been my favorite mail client for years, it just works once you've set up everything. Perfect for IMAP. Only small issues: Since my switch to an Android 5 device, Android's menu soft-key (long-press Recents button) doesn't work any longer to open the menu in K-9. And since my device's upgrade to Android 6, K-9 seems to "forget" it has internet access after a while and stops receiving new mail by itself, and only continues once the device switches from 3G/4G to Wi-Fi or back.

	   The Android default email app is v boring n dull. I use K-9 for my two Outlook, one Yahoo and one own domain accounts. My two Gmail accounts are handled by default Gmail app. Though I thought it was slow in push notifications, but that seems to be working ok now. Everything I want from an email app works flawlessly in K-9. It's lightweight and superior in overall performance. Thumbs up!

	  I don't have and android device, but do have Chrome on GNU/Linux. I do however set up email for Android users and this is the one that is painless and works as expected. This is no surprise as it started as patches for the still broken Android email. Would be good if there was a similar Chrome app that cached IMAP data locally. When I trade my iDevice for a Nexus I will be using this. Now running it in ARC Welder on Chrome on GNU/Linux.

	   Lots of options for customising the display, interaction etc. For me the best features are the ability to display messages in full screen and increase text size.

	<comment>
	   Really like app, can display msgs and headers exactly how you want to. Biggest problem is retrieving gmail headers is slow and hit n miss along with viewing emails often will not view. Has great search function, but yet again is not reliable when searching gmail databse.. Pls fix these problems. Can be 5 Star.

	<title>Poor user interface</title>
	<comment>
	   This is the most functional email client yet. Does everything you want. The only reason I am not using it is because the UI is terrible and clunky and feels very depressed. No themes, no skins, etc. (Also not sure if possible but it would be terrific if the app could import settings and accounts already installed on the system, much like how Firefox can import from chrome and vice versa)

	<title>Huh? Still no single button for s simple reply. Still no pic resizing. Must be a fabulous development cycle. USE THE BIG TRACKER... which they've made so simple to understand. I went there, couldn't make heads or tails of it. So much for community.</title>
	<comment>
	   I have only been using it for a few months and right now what I find "surprising" is that there seems to not be a single tap way of replying. I mean, are you pooping me? Other than that, so far it seems like it might be okay. But we'll see. UNFORTUNATELY, I actually stopped using it, because attaching pics, they go out full size. THIS IS ON A PHONE. Not like I've got the dexterity or inclination to work in multiple apps just to send pictures that won't use all my data.

	   This is, hands down, the best fit for my mobile e-mail needs. But it still seems sketchy on Goggle鈥檚 idea of folders (tags) and tends to download all e-mail for your inbox when using POP3, regardless of read status or folder/tag location.

	   ...but way too much to go through to set up. Also, there seems to be no way to update your password once it's changed, other than uninstalling and reinstalling (which means going through the extensive setup again). EDIT: The set up is still too exhaustive, but this is by far the best client app I've used (since the security issue with gMail has been addressed).

	  This app used to be the best IMAP mail reader on android. But with two major problems, it has became quite useless on android 鈮? 5 : - no way to 鈥渂ounce鈥? mail (redirect with full headers unchanged)聽; - incredibly slooooooow to display mails. More than 1" to display a mail, or to take a swipe in account. If you have an old android system, it is a MUST HAVE. Else, you better consider an alternative, such as Inbox or Cloud Mail, and it is a pitty. Nota : "Show contact names", in Settings > Global settings > Display, have to be disabled in android 5+ as a workaround for the slow scroll & display.

	  After trying a number of different apps, I was frustrated by the overkill so many of them thrust upon you. I wanted a clean, fast, truly useful app for using on my phone quickly and easily. After using K-9 Mail for a while now, I am completely happy with it. I appreciate being able to set the "dark theme" for one thing. I also appreciate being able to simply click on the icon and get an immediate, updated list of my emails with the first couple of sentences included. It is all easy to scan and scroll through without a lot of unneeded visual garbage or options. When you need an additional option, it appears at the logical place and time, not all the time whether you need it or not. Everything is easy to set and use, and K-9 integrates well with my Google email account. This is one of the very few apps of any type that I've found to be genuinely suited to and useful for quick-and-direct cellphone use.

	   Alot of great features. However it has issues with email syncing and it can drain your battery unexpectedly. There's no easy way to kill a sync job without force quitting the app, inherently the app should kill any sync attempt that takes an excessive amount of time but it doesn't.

	   Hi there guys. This app was the best app for emails till date. I hoped that it stays on my phone for ever but the recent sync issues have been a problem for me. Even though setting everything properly it doesn't give me push notifications for the new emails, and always displays syncing disabled which I have not. Fix this problem will return back to 5 stars.

	  Push notifications don't seem to work reliably. I can see open IMAP connections to the server but it won't report new messages. Doing a manual "fetch" will eventually retrieve new messages but takes an inordinate amount of time. Disabling power saving features doesn't help. Android 6.0.1 on Nexus 6P.

	   I am using it for about a year now and just love it. The decryption and verification with pgp works like a charm, though sometimes it quotes the encrypted message in a reply (rare cases). There is however 1 thing that bugs me, I never use the instant reply button in the notification, but sometimes I wold love to instantly delete some spam messages preferably right in the notification (I do unfortunately get quite a lot of those). Oh and maybe a function to search all the messages on an imap server.

	   There is so much to like about this app. It is with real regret that I am probably going to uninstall it because I can't get it to work for me. I am using it on Android 6 with eight accounts using pop3. The problem is that mail is downloaded on some accounts only to disappear, never to be seen again. I have googled this (and the problem is widespread) but no answers that work. I am prepared to believe that it is a configuration issue but I am obviously too thick to work it out. And there is no manual.

	   Feature rich and works really well. I love that it's open source. The user interface is very dated, though. Text and buttons are crammed on my display. Colors are less than appealing. Terrible UX makes this difficult to use.

	   It has a GOOD dark theme (very important to me); the interface is simple, easy to work with, intuitive, and highly customizable. If you're like me, you want an email app that keeps track of your email safely and simply, an app that doesn't bog itself down with glitz and bloat, and at the same time, doesn't sacrifice the option to add complexity or information detail the way many Google and similar ones do. K-9 does exactly what I want it to do simply and efficiently. And it's free, with no adds

	<comment>
	   I like K9, it's so far the best app for multiple accounts and with no single ad! Thank you ! Thank you ! Thank you ! It take some time to figure it how it works, but when you get it, it's a piece of cake. My second device so far with it. I tried on this one some newer email aps, like BlueMail, but they have lots of ads, and pop ups for comercials, so I got the old one, old but gold K9, and I'm in piece now. K9 is maybe a litle complicated, and maybe look outdated, but it's all crap. THIS APP RULZ!

	<comment>
	   Please please please please allow at least one user folder, eg "Pending" (pop3) - then you'll get your otherwise richly deserved 5th star. Sometimes deleted emails arise from the dead again. But apart from that, it's a great app!

	   Tried the app on my nexus 7 for my work exchange mails, but it failed to work. Could not find server even though the settings work fine with lots of other mail clients. Surprised that this highly rated app struggles to do automatically find ones exchange account and set it up accordingly. Maybe I'm doing something wrong.

	   I like k9, but it's a major battery drainer on the latest Android. Also according to the reports on the intarwebs I am not alone with that problem. Apparently it does let your phone go to deep sleep (wake lock and/or mobile active)

	<comment>
	   I like K9 and wanted an email client for accounts separate from Gmail etc., but this service has used what I consider to be higher quantity of mobile data compared to other services. It's set to minimum demand but still too greedy, so regrettably will be removed for something more lightweight.

	   Work Exchange or personal POP3/IMAP, I've tried all three and k9 won't connect to any of them. I find it odd that no other mail app I've used had this problem, yet this is supposed to be one of the best mail apps available.

	<comment>
	   I've been Using k-9 for years. Overall it does a decent job. It doesn't allow html signatures and more recently the setting for sending mail as Outlook style or Gmail styles won't switch. On my new Galaxy S7 Edge it's now stuck on Gmail style and puts my signature at the very bottom of all email replies. Unfortunately this is enough for me uninstall.

	   I've used this ever since i got my first android phone over five years ago, and love it. The only thing that could be better is a fix for starring emails - when tapping the star on an email, it scrolls the interface instead.

	   I have always been delighted with this app but recently it seems to entirely hog resources when checking mail. This is a particular difficulty in a poor service areas. The wee circles just sit there blocking any activity on the phone until you give up. There seems nothing that can be done to stop the sync happening in this case other than switch off. Nexus 6 latest Android.

	<comment>
	   Sad to uninstall K9 as I have used it for years. I like its visual approach among other things. But its become buggy/unstable and now I am faced with syncing disabled and no way to fix it. Emailed support and was directed to the manual and G+ community. No fix in manual and post to community asking for help unanswered. Had no choice but to make the switch to another email client for android. Sorry K9 but I guess all good things end. Bye!

	   There is no info where I am. I want a global setting for storing mail. I WANT A GLOBAL APP PASSWORD! Same for number of mail to scan for. Same for other settings too. The app is badly structured. Half an hour ago I had to reboot my i9195 device to make K9 stop syncing. I don't want auto sync. I don't understand what the f*ck the app is doing. I hate this stupid app. 2016-05-04 Uninstalled the app. I use a payed R2Mail now.

	   At the very start it states the the majority of free hotmail accounts won't work. I use hotmail almost exclusively. A lot of people do. I like that the developers don't mind reviews but want a chance to fix a problem. Only thing is the app itself says it doesn't work. I was hopeful but now disappointed.

	<title>Rapid sync, no clutter, privacy</title>
	<comment>
	   Thanks to the developers for this wonderful application which replaces my android stock app. I almost gave up on finding a mail app which doesn't ask for a ton of permissions until I found K9. A few minor suggestions for improvements: It should be possible to move mails to folders of different accounts, and generally the moving of mails could still be simplified. Another desirable feature would be a rapid delete gesture and an undo button for the last move/delete action.

	<comment>
	   So recently I've been having problems with K9 mail and despite my best efforts it still persists. I have had problems checking my other accounts on it after checking one of them, for instance if I check one email account and then try to check another the program just hangs. I have to clear the cache and force a stop for it to work again. So that being said I'm switching.

	<title>Ok but could be better</title>
	<comment>
	   4/06/2012 - A little outdated in how it looks, could be better in describing how to setup ie actually give the option for push or manual sync. Add a schedule for when mail is synced and then give option to just manual sync etc outside of those times. These are only things tying me to stock! 23/4/2016 - same applies....only this time gmail fails to configure as the app doesn't comply with modern security standards...oh well..2nd attempt in 4 years ends in disappointment again..

	  The best. Better than the stock Gmail app for IMAP, because the minimum for that is 15 minutes. To me, that could spell disaster for time critical emails. 1&1 supports IMAP IDLE, which this BEAUTIFULLY supports! Gmail app... "Duh...What's IMAP IDLE?" Whoop whoop MMFWCL to the developer!

	   Seems it doesn't want to accept my works email exchange account. Keeps saying a valid url for the exchange account could not be found. It's funny because plenty of other email apps don't have a problem. And why are the time and date on the emails so far behind the actual time and date? Get it sorted, K9!

	   The latest update is just amazing. The rewamp of the look and the newly organized buttons, check mail by pulling down the screen... This app just beats the sh*t out of the other competitors out there! Thanks K9-devteam for the BEST email client out there! I have one suggestion for number-recognition: +NNN NNN NNN NNN etc. In other words +-sign and any amount of numbers with a space, dot, dash etc should be recognized as a phonenumber. + stands for 00 in phonenumbers in many countries.

	   You know about this restriction ONLY after downloading, installing and giving away your privacy to this piece of crapware and spyware trash. Why developers don't mention it in the description is to grab as many as possible fake installations. Uninstalled straight away even if I got more than one mail account, but I don't like misleading people and trashware.

	  Don't let the stupid looking icon fool you, this is a VERY GOOD app! It does everything an email client should do. However, it is not all that different from Android's default email client. I would just use the Android default email client instead of this.

	   Have used K-9 for a few days now. It's fast...Probably because it's a fairly light weight minimalist client. I have searched to no avail for a SPAM filter. I may have to abandon K-9 if that's not an option.

	<comment>
	   1. Hierarchical folders are flattened to an oversized list of all folders. Very bad when there are hundreds or thousands of year/month/day folders under some topics. The good part is that K-9 does not lump together all my e-mails in a "unified inbox" and doesn't send my e-mails to any server but my own.

	   Does everything need in a mail client. It is also light weight without the bloat. Showing how a mail app doesn't need to be 10s of MBs to do the job.

	<title>Defacto is a bit disappointing</title>
	<comment>
	   It's a well known mail client for a long time - almost the defacto standard for 3rd party Android mail clients perhaps. But it feels like it needs an interface overhaul. Just feels a bit dated and stale. Functionality is good but for me I found connectivity to exchange by owa far slower than other clients I've tried. Also it seems unable to deal properly with nested folders. Some folders I've been unable to see at all.

	   Upgraded V4.804 to V5.1 & switched from APG to OpenKeyChain without a hitch. Tested 4 signed messages so far. I'm liking it. I wish we could create rich content with images, or html but what K9 does currently, it does very well. K9 is well supported but they understandibly seem to prefer communicating via their google groups forum.

	<comment>
	   As fare as options and configuerability goes it is awesome. The UI is sometimes a bit clumsy to use and could use a make over. I also wish I could configure filters to automatically sort my mail into folders. This is especially usfull with mailing list messages, that clutter up your inbox. Otherwise best mail client available.

	   It's got to be one of the best e-mail clients for Android. I originally replaced Google Mail with K9 on my Tablet. Since the last update, though, it's refusing to send half of my emails. I just get them placed in my outbox, and permanently stuck there. A pity as it's otherwise a good program.

	  UNINSTALLED: Hoping that this would be a good replacement for the email client that came with the phone, However, when I tried to set it up, both Google and Yahoo servers complained about the lack of security. Software states that it will not connect to HotMail. Sorry to uninstall this one, looked like it was feature rich, and besides ... I like dogs. :)

	   Good app. Has some minor issues that are interface design oriented. Not sure if this is an Android exclusive problem, but starring email from initial screen is a pain. Will scroll up email instead of starring. Not a deal breaker. Also searching for old mail is not very intuitive. Finding sent mail could be easier. I do like and use it every day. Will never replace Gmail.

	   Simply good user friendly, many features you can find it better compare to android default email client.... it has the option of self configurable "auto bcc" for all out going mail, that is really helpful when you can trace all email that you had sent via mobile phone.

	   Works very well with IMAP, easy to use and easy to set up. I have been an open source user for nearly 20 years and if I have a choice, I always pick an open source product. Keep up the good work!

	<comment>
	   Have been using K9 2 years now. Took a bit of working out to set up correctly, but it was worth it - ever since it has worked flawlessly. Using multiple email accounts, using IMAP Push with Polling turned off it uses almost no battery. Simple to use, easy to read, intuitive. The best UI of all email clients I've looked at.

	  Best of all! Customizable and simple to use (though not to tune it up :)))) Also I'd suggest changing the app logo, wouldn't it be better to make something more like an envelope and less like a dog?

	<title>Best mail client for Android</title>
	<comment>
	   The design of the app looks somewhat old-fashioned and the configuration menu structure is more complicated than I would like it to be, but all things considered this is by far the best email client available for Android. I've tried Gmail, and liked it too, but unfortunately that app cannot send plain text messages! Can you believe it? K9 won't give you that kind of trouble. Also, I believe it's the only email client for Android that supports IMAP IDLE .

	   I've used this for a year or two on my Xperia Z2 without a worry. I've just installed it onto Z5 phone to discover you can't open a new email or reply when it's held in landscape mode. That icon is missing on the top of the screen and only visible on the bottom when held in portrait.

	  Everything works smoothly, looks beautiful and bright until... you realize that there's no way to undelete messages for pop3 accounts and that messages that you definitely never ever touched end up in the trash folder (probably when they get purged on the server, which should have nothing to do with the contents of local pop3 folders). Two no-goes.

	   Powerful email client. I highly recommend this app as an alternative to the native android app, which is super basic let's face it. Although I guess K9 is only really useful if you have multiple email accounts of which some or all are not GMail accounts.

	<comment>
	   Overall I love this app.. wish there was a mail reader this powerful for my iPad. But this latest version broke it, at least for me. I think there might be settings, but i can't find anything. Previous version, all starred emails stayed on top. Now, not only is that no longer, but even read emails go to bottom. I want emails to stay in order received, read or otherwise. and i really liked starred posts on top, although i can live without that since you can load them by touching the star.

	<comment>
	   I use IMAP and this app gets confused between live emails and deleted ones. It is pulling emails deleted 2 days previous into the inbox as of they have just arrived. I have verified through other devices that they are deleted. Makes the inbox unuseable as keeps filling up with old emails.

	<comment>
	   I like K-9 Email, but the UI needs some improvement. One of the features I am missing particularly is splitting message list and message content panes vertically on top of each other. On a phone, the side-by-side split is useless. Also, sliding the boundary between these panes would be handy.

	<comment>
	   RECENT ISSUE - There's a bug that causes the screen to scroll up unpredictability whenever you zoom in...its maddening. I will try to reinstall. K9 is the only Android email client that I can tolerate. It's ugly and slightly confusing when using the back button with multiple email accounts. But the back button is more of an inherent problem of Android's than with the app. Except for this recent bug, it's a usable email client that I use because there aren't any better alternatives atm.

	   K9 is not a bad email client - I've used it for several years, but you can't send to Groups you defined in your Contacts. If it didn't have this limitation (and it may not matter to many people), I'd give it 5 stars. It's awesome for managing multiple email accounts!

There is a way to contact the developer, but it is too complicated for me. Hopefully someone could get in touch with me and help me with this? Still love the app!!!!!!

	   I cannot get beyond the fugly UI. I am pretty old school so it is not that the UI is outdated. It would have been called awfully ugly 20 years ago. All those blocky letters in different colors makes me think I am looking at a shareware program from 1995. On the plus side, it did setup my Yahoo account easily. However, there should be a choice where to store the emails and not just downloads.

	   No longer works with Gmail, app doesn't meet modern security standard according to Google. Shame too as I prefer this app's layout to Gmail app but looks like I no longer have that choice. Completely useless to me as is, so downgraded to 1 star, I'll happily start using it again and rate back to 5 stars if this issue is fixed.

	   2-21-2016: is there a way to print an email like I print pdf files? (Older) I use this app for both business and personal use on multiple devices. It works great.

	   It works, but I can't figure out how to add more than one account, and it would be nice if you could add custom folders.

	  Needs a UI update. But not full Material, this is a email client, low information density is not good.

	<title>Filters? Auto-check without sync?</title>
	<comment>
	   Please add filters/rules so I can set certain emails from not downloading, or specify which to download. Also would love to see an option to check mail automatically even when sync is disabled. Thank you.

	  Hi, I have a very simple request, please allow "Mark for Deletion" and "Unmark" ... also, show the message with a strikethrough if it is marked for deletion -- regardless of where that marked for deletion was made. Thank you. AndrewM Edit: I would like to upgrade my rating, but you need to address this issue first.

	<title>What happened?</title>
	<comment>
	   Worked great on my Kyocera Hydro Vibe with outdated Android. Now with my Moto G3 the app shuts down over and over, reading emails, loading, sending, but mostly switching between email accounts. Really sucka because I've been using K9 for quite some time and it is the best email app there is. Well it WAS until I updated phones. Sad that K9 mail isn't able to handle the upgrade.

	   I've been a heavy email user for many many years and on Windows and Microsoft Outlook user and I did not want to sacrifice with a minimal email client that hardly does anything at all other than let you read messages. I like more control over everything and this is the only program available on Android that gives you total control and works!

	  Update: now PUSH works again, so it's back as my preferred mail app. I'd like to have a button to get back to main accounts list in a single step, instead to push the back button several times, and a new "modern" appearance. Four stars only because of the outdated look, the app works great.

	   Works as advertised apart from a few bugs here and there. Most reliable and tunable IMAP sync app that I've found for android. The biggest gripe is the UI though. It's 2016 and the design is not just outdated but simply horrible in this day and age.

	<title>Excellent Email App!</title>
	<comment>
	   I tried this because I absolutely hated the built-in Android 5 Gmail app, and I really love K9 mail! K9 mail does everything the Gmail app can't do, and I use it for Gmail! I like an app that does one thing, but does it extremely well, and for email, this is THE app to get. And thank you to the developers for keeping this ad free!

	   Google sent message to my backup secondary gmail address via android Google gmail app saying insecure app attempted email fetch so was not allowed. Google default security setting. Using link in their email I found box to tap to allow unverified app access. But K9 still can't fetch that mail. I tried K9 because Google email app filling up android system memory and won't allow saving to non system internal storage or micro sd card. Working now after setting Google acct allow unverified.

	  I've used this app for years to view my email via my tablet and smartphone. I've had few problems with it and it performs solidly. The only issue I've had is with sending email using ssl. Sometimes, the email won't sync because the certificate is "invalid" as it states. Simply resending the email usually resolves the issue. However, the message is not apparent as it doesn't pop up in the app. You have to watch for it in your notifications.

	<comment>
	   The app is great and I use it for work constantly the one complaint I do have is that the delete button needs to be moved from the center of the bottom row. It is entirely too easy to delete important email. Thinking you're closing the app. Even with the option to validate it occurs. This would certainly be a 5 star review if that change was made.

	<comment>
	   This *used* to be great, however since May 2015, I've been unable to get ANY new email across any of my many email accounts - and as such have had to get accustomed to Google's main offering. I updated K-9 tonight, but it refuses every account I have, saying either the username and/or password is at fault, when none of them are incorrect. Result: Uninstalled.

	   Far better than any native email APP. Some changes in the folder list are non reversible but and if you do any mistake you may need to delete and add again the account. But everything else works great

I would like to rename and reorder folders. E.g first folder "[GMAIL]/BIN (Trash)" That is the last folder I want to see and to have the displayname of "BIN"

	   Best mail client for advanced users stable, powerful and customizable. Opensource is a plus. The interface is not evolving much. My biggest complaint: battery drain significantly increased in the latest update. It might not be related to K-9. Mail server issue? I did not change my settings.

	   Update (Dec 2015). Still by far the best email client. /// (2013) I have used K9 for several years for my non-gmail account. The current official version is 4.409, and it is excellent. However, today I installed the latest version posted at the K9 Mail developer's site, 4.512, and additional improvements make this email client stand out by some distance. Even in comparison with Gmail. Wow!

	  Although this is the BEST email app on the market, If you would only add a simple feature. And that is, the option to be able to move messages from your inbox to a folder of choice. I always have to forward mail, then during the procedure discard it, and save it as a draft. If I were a programmer, I would offer to help make this happen. This "move mail" function is so needed to make this a 5 star app. Thanks

	  K-9 still has some basic issues. I found an email in my sent folder that I was looking for. No problem. Later in the day, it (and a few others) were suddenly gone from the sent folder even though it is in the sent folder when viewed from my desktop client.

	<comment>
	   There isn't much not to like about this email client and it has worked flawlessly on test. But the only feature that is missing is access protection. I can't believe anyone could develop such a great client and miss out such an important security feature for a mobile device. I really don't want my email available to just anyone who picks up my phone. I am calling on the dev to add a password on start , or for another developer to make a plugin to add this missing important feature to K9 mail.

	  Great email client for Android, if you have the skill and patience to set up your IMAP accounts manually. Ability to adjust FONT size is limited when using on a Tablet. On a high-res screen, you'll need your magnifying reading glasses. I'm running K9 on my Chromebook via the Google ARC Welder re-packaging environment. It works well except you can't deal with attachments because K9 doesn't know how to deal with the Chrome OS file system. (Chrome OS is lacking a complete email client for combining email accounts.) Build a Chrome OS version, and give us older folks larger fonts and this would be a five star app.

	   I have used K-9 for a number of years. It previously worked wonderfully. However, it now constantly freezes and crashes. Displaying a single email can regularly take 30 seconds. I would dearly love to see this wonderful app updated to resolve these problems. Running on Note 4, latest stock Verizon Android version.

	   battery reports 15%battery usage ,ouch! Tried limiting connection time to no avail. K9 remainsin memory when exciting, not good. I understand services still run, but program should not be in memory when properly exciting. I get a ton of k-9 errors regularly. It needs a serious maintenance update. Is anyone else having any issues? Time to move on. no dev support what so ever for theadapp. No support. No updates.gone to k-@mail worksgreat! Lowbattery usage! Aqua mail looksgoodtoo, but like getK-@ 鉁?

	<comment>
	   For private email clients I have found no better app. No ads, no useless junk. I have used this app since I have had a smart phone. Tried others for different reasons always come back.

	  EDIT: Privacy/security leak will be fixed with next major update. Privacy/security risk: K-9 honours meta-refresh and will open browser links directly upon opening a mail which uses them. That is VERY bad. Other than that, it is very user un-friendly, ugly and doesn't work all too good. Still, it is one of the few non-cloud based email clients, which is very sad.

	  Works well with multiple accounts. Simple clean interface. What more could you want. One of my mail accounts is Hotmail. When I heard that Microsoft was changing the Outlook app to something worse, I tried K9 with Hotmail and it worked perfectly. (I also use it with another private email account that I have.) BTW all the complaining about the new Outlook app seems to be nonsense as it works perfectly. Still use K9 with my other email account.

	<comment>
	   I selected the option to remove messages from the server when I delete them in k-9, but it won't actually do it. I've Googled this to death and found lots of "solutions" on various forums, none of which have worked for me. The app should simply do what the option selected SAYS it will do.

	   It's an amazing mailer giving you full control over your email handling. I think other commentators can hardly blame k9mail for their technical issues; sometimes "bad" mail providers just don't enable all features. and it's definitely possible to get lost in the extensive settings that are individual per added account. I use 4 accounts and I am very satisfied.

	   I love this app, but it seems a recent update has moved the reply, reply all and forward buttons to a submenu in the menu: menu -&gt; send -&gt; reply. That's tedious and it took me five minutes to find it :( Please change that back to buttons as before! I'm on an Asus TF701t, the above is the case for landscape and portrait mode.

	   If you want a great e-mail app, with user-friendly interface, all of the functions you can think of and a nice widget, then look no further. I have been using it for years and I never found myself missing a feature. If there would be anything I wish the devs to improve, it would be more themes.

	<title>Best Email app! And I've tried a lot!</title>
	<comment>
	   This is a very customizable email app that does everything you want from an email app. I didn't love it the first time I tried it, but after spending a few minutes setting it up the way I want it, I realize it's the best email app available! Keep up the good work! It would be nice if there was a local folder where emails could be saved and not lost when it's not in the most recent 25/50/...

	<title>Double notification</title>
	<comment>
	   When I receive a mail I get a double notification, it says that I got two mails. Opening the app just shows one mail and I only have one account. This account is set with webdav/owa. I tried deleting the app data and reconfiguring the account but the double mail notifications still appear. Also more often than not, the app stops synchronizing for no apparent reason. It says "next synch at xx" but when the time comes no action is done.

	  I've loved K-9 mail since I first got my Xperia but last update made it perfect! Right from notification bar new K-9 email can be selected and buttons on side let me choose and delete individual mail. Color selections are fun too. Highly recommend. Sometimes my email arrives on phone before computers. Still working flawlessly on MOTO X2 - Lollipop! New mail notifications always appear on lock screen (Nova launcher) and even show on watch (MOTO 360) so for the folks that aren't being notified I suggest checking your other app settings. K9 mail even allows for replies by sliding down from notification bar! I use my phone for business emails and K-9 Mail has never let me down.

	   It's slow, gets stuck loading on junk all the time, difficult to configure and a nightmare to add aliases. However, I can very highly recommend "nine" which is so much better. It's honestly worth every penny.

	  The best POP/SMTP mail client, of those I've tried, available from Play Store. Four issues short of a 5-start rating: 1. The too-frequent 'crash and die' failures. 2. No indication of which account I'm dealing with when in any of the settings pages. Perhaps the account name beside the page title [Settings - nsaportal@gmail.con] would be a solution. 3. No spelling checker (please start with en-gb ;-). 4. The 'Unread messages' indicator shown on the widget selector, doesn't exist. However, these minor 'niggles' won't stop me using K-9 or send me out in search of a replacement. Big-ups to the developers; excellent work! Is this project still in development or are these issues never going to be addressed?

	<comment>
	   I've used k9 for years. I've connected all 6 of my email accounts. I've managed an email/web server for the past 21 years. This was the best I've used. However I'm on Nexus devices only now so I get the latest & greatest updates when they become available. It's been three months now and the certificate issues I only see with k9 are not fixed. So even though my overall rating should be five stars, I'm uninstalling and dropping my rating. Besides, the gmail app now does much of what I used k9 for so...

	<comment>
	   Constant AUTH PLAIN failed when sending. K9 also has a bug where it can partially download a message, just partial headers and then can never get the whole message, the email then appears to be corrupted and listed as 'no subject', and nothing will bring it back. Also, related... k9 can't retrieve attachments over phone data these days. Only WiFi. Needs fix. Gone crap.

	<title>Doesn't populate account information well to other devices</title>
	<comment>
	   Exporting account settings to device memory or external storage is done easily. However the other device is INCAPABLE of retrieving that information from local storage for import. The import procedure INSISTS that you provide a file from a cloud service (Google Drive or Drop Box). I find that to be an insecure option.

	  Wouldn't sync my Gmail without 'allowing less secure apps' in Google account settings, which I didn't like. However the Gmail app is now so bloated and slow on my phone that I had to find an alternative and, apart from the security concern, this seems to work faster.

	   I have been quite happy with this app. However, recently I have been facing a problem. Though I have set the download mail size to be only 32kb, I have been receiving mails with the entire size of attachments, even beyond 32kb. This has led to an increase of my data charges exponentially!!!

	   If you are looking for a mail app that does everything and I mean everything that a full blown desktop mail app can do then look no further. I especially needed an app that gave me the ability to create identities on accounts and to set a "reply to" address on an account and K9 came to the rescue. There are so many advanced settings it is clear that the author wrote this due to not finding anything out there that could do what he wanted. Highly recommended mail app. Also works 100% on a Blackberry Z10.

	   Was a long long time user of K9. Never really failed me until recently. Decided to try another App for awhile so deleted my email accounts, cleared the data file & stopped the program in App settings so it wouldn't be using data. Noticed my mobile was transmiting data a long time, checked & K9 had transmited more than 630MB of what I don't know. I ran virus scans to no avail so have uninstalled.

	   I need an email app that is highly configurable and is easy to use on a constant basis. I have multiple accounts setup, and K9Mail covers all of the requirements I have except one... And its very minor. I'd like it to vibrate ONLY when new mail arrives. Notifications are either on or off...no in between. There is no custom setup for Notifications. If this was a feature of K9Mail, I'd rate it Five stars.

	   Even if it's still missing some nice options... Continue your great work my friends! To the one arguing about the GUI, IMO, it's the perfection. Sleek, fast and stable. All to do is waiting for couple ameliorations. For example, where is the unread count on the icon ? It's a must on any email client, not only on the widget icon. First time I saw email app without this simple option. Will give 5 stars after couple addons. I promise, Thanks. Do you read your reviews and propositions on options to add ? Thx.

	<title>Great Features, Easy on the Battery</title>
	<comment>
	   I usually don't rate apps, because I don't like how Google uses my comments to promote stuff to my family & friends. That being said, I love K9mail! It's not the prettiest email app, but it does what I need, and it does it well. Gmail and multiple imap accounts, good navigation, and this puppy is fast! Using the arrows to scroll to the previous/next email is almost instantaneous. And it doesn't drain the battery. It's all good!

	<comment>
	   This is definitely the best email app on Android when it comes to functionality. However, more and more apps are now adopting the Material design and I would love to see k9 do the same. Are we to expect any updates?

	   my preferrered mail client for android. behaves nicely, very flexible, doesn't get in the way, snoop or come sneaking back when told to go away, unlike the vendor email & gmail clients. unfotunately it has decided to set a default account on it's own recently, overriding my long standing preference and ignoring changes. this has caused problems that cannot be fixed. i don't know why it's been changed to do that but i want it to heed my preference.

	<comment>
	   Used work great for many years now as my all in one email app. Recently it cannot send from Gmail account unless one changes the google account security settings to "allow less secure apps" then all is back to usual function. Why is K9 now a less secure app? I don't think it's reasonable to lower your overall account security just to get this app to work properly.

	<comment>
	   Features are awesome as it's truly the best email client I've used. Although, on my xperia at least, this app drains the battery noticeably. I notice it's always keeping wake locks up and I assume this is so that it receives emails as they come, but, even when I change the poll settings to "never" it still hits the battery pretty good. Still a bad a*# email client though.

	<comment>
	   I love everything about it, but the only thing keeping it from a 5 is that my system managers tell me that it restarts constantly. Sometimes as often as every minute. You don't see this without the managers, but I can tell with my battery performance. I just reinstalled it. If it seems like it stopped, I'll change it to a 5!

	<title>Serious looping issues</title>
	<comment>
	   Works fine most of the time but, apparently by faulty design, gets stuck in loops when something doesn't go it's way. One example is a failed send. It will try forever to get the message sent that results in persistent notifications with a rapid blinking notification light that eats battery. The message is no longer in the out box so there's no way to stop it. There's also no setting for disabling that notification. The only resolution is to disable or uninstall the app.

	<title>NOT the best email app for android. In fact not even better than stock.</title>
	<comment>
	   So many times i've tried k9 mail now and came back disappointed every time. It crashes randomly, is impossible to set up with Exchange and does not even properly support Push! The app boasts to be best android email app but in fact is not even better than the stock android mail client. Quite the contrary! In stock client you just enter MS Exchange email address and password, done. Not so in k9! Maybe one day when k9 mail does not suck I'll give it 5 stars. Until then, 1 star for repeatedly wasting my time.

	<comment>
	   Used it on different devices. Really good functionallity... BUT one thing always made me uninstall (and reinstall) it: once it is running on a system for a longer period of time... it starts draining.the battery like crazy. It ever happens right away, but on all devices I used it on it suddenly starts...without any kind of recognizable cause. Didn't happen after an update, no change to the system whatsoever, no other apps recently installed.that could interfere with it. Finally giving up on it for good!

	<comment>
	   Read emails turn as unread. App should keep local statuses for mails and check when status is properly updated with server if not then do it again. Communication with email servers hang and this also causes emails transferred to folders not going there and reappear in Inbox. Reading mails from search results is extremely slow (15 sec to open a mail). Should fix the source code but have no time. //arl

	  Excellent app. Does exactly what it should. Very configurable and very easy to set up. No problems at all. Highly recommended. I switched from the terrible MS Outlook app and definitely would never go back!

	<comment>
	   This was my go to mail client for years. I was comfortable with it and loved it. Recently, I have had some issues I can't resolve and there doesn't seem to be an easy way to get tech support. The issue now is that gmails keep getting pulled down to phone even after read and deleted on phone. Only non read mail should be pulled down. I'm looking for a new app as I can't figure out how to fix what should normally be an easy fix.

	   I've had this phone a year now.... why did I never hear of this app!!!??? Built in pgp signing and encryption is great. I just don't like how it shows labels in Gmail. .. hundreds of expanded sub labels instead of in a collapsible folder like display otherwise a great app.

	   This is one of the best Email apps on android. .I can even get microsoft exchange on it. The only problem I am having is getting Microsoft Outlook to work on it. Also I wish it had widgets. Probably should have given it 5 stars.

	   Does not properly fit the screen of a Galaxy Note 4 as there is some bleed through on the left hand side from whatever wallpaper the user has on their home screen. This makes the themes look a little weird. Good app othwerwise.

	<comment>
	   One of the best email front end for android l have seen but only 4 stars as it is missing a must have feature all other email programs have: the icon on your screen not only does not tell you how many unread messages you have but it doesn't even change to tell you that you have received a new email. The only way to find out is to launch the app. Come on guys, even Microsoft knew how to do that 25 years ago!

	   Not sure if by design, opened message clicked on the show pictures button. Closed message, reopened same message later, and the show pictures button was there, but the message was still showing pictures. How does one revert the message back to its original state without the pictures showing?

	  I have used this for a while, and it was great. Now, for some reason, it is so slow as to be unusable. Scrolling the list of messages takes 10 seconds or more, so long that the Android says the app is unresponsive. I have taken the steps to clear data, but that has not helped. If they get it fixed, I'll give it 5 stars again. That is, if I go back to it, as I HAVE to find another email app. This one is not at all usable.

	   Used to really like. I changed my password on on Gmail and for some reason refuses to take my new password. The app doesn't give proper error messages so I have no idea what is wrong. Google complains that this app doesn't meet security standards anymore. Was great hoping it gets fixed up but for now I am begrudgingly moving to the official Gmail app

	<comment>
	   Buttons at top on new big phones not good. Share hard to get to and not availiable in message list view. Scroll cursor in the way of star botton. Try to star a message and scrolls instead. Phone numbers not clickable or hyperlinked. Bad deal for a cell phone app. All these things are very frustrating on the Galaxy s5. All worked great with old version on Evo 4g. Use them all the time and makes me want to find a new app. Have to also get emails sent to stock email to call, then go to K9 to fight and share.

	   But lately seems to be having problems. I get certificate errors every couple of weeks and the only recommended solution is to delete and reinstall my accounts. It also seems to forget that I want messages deleted from the server anytime an update to the software is made, causing me to have to delete email twice, the second time when I use a different device.

	   80% of the time, deleting email's results in crash notification: "Unfortunately K-9 Mail has stopped." just too irritating to accept. Submitting crash reports have resulted in no feedback from K-9 let alone a problem fix. It's really a shame because it has my favorite look & features. Manage 2 important POP3 email accounts & need better reliability /stability.

	   Within first 5 min of setting up, it's pretty obvious that this software is infinitely better than stock Gmail app. Doesn't spy on you like Gmail app does (check the hidden .face folder that fills when Gmail app runs, change file extensions to .jpg to see) This app has a very friendly intuitive feel to it and even the notifications are more helpful! Highly recommend! UPDATE: Dinged one star for annoying "feature" that I can't disable: scrollbar on right interferes w/ starring emails. Have to open them. :/

	<title>The Very Devil To Set Up</title>
	<comment>
	   Might be the best email client in the world for all I know, but its far too fiddly to set up. All the other clients I tried were easy - enter username and password; bish bosh job done for most accounts. By contrast getting "cannot connect to server" after using the exact same methods that work with other clients is frustrating in the extreme. I don't want to be forced to post on a forum and be told to try a number of convoluted steps, or to contact my various email providers simply to get the thing working

	  This app stores email passwords & usernames in plain text in preferences_storage database. I verified myself & (after using an online base64 decoder from a 1sec google search) my password was there plain as day. What this means: ROOTED PHONE: any app with root access, or person (or malicious software) using your phone now has access to all your email passwords. NON-ROOTED PHONE: All it takes is an adb backup (requires pluging a usb cable into phone) Or, malicious software using exploit to gain root access to file, stealing passwords. K-9 Mail isn't only mail app with this vulnerability. To test if your passwords are vulnerable: re-start phone, access mail app. If you are able to download & read mail without entering any password, your passwords are VERY vulnerable. But also, even if you have to enter a password you could still be vulnerable depending on how the app stores your passwords. More research would be needed at that point.

	<comment>
	   Would love to see an option to disable showing of the full e-mail address in the account list and only show the display name. Firstly to save some space in the list, and secondly to not let anyone looking over your screen to know your addresses. Also, email notifications seem to break the back button. I.e. if I click on an email notification, after viewing the email, pressing back does not return me to the previous, but the home screen. Thanks!

	   Recently saw massive battery drain and it somehow managed to use 2gb of data in a couple of hours which meant I had to buy more mobile data. Couldn't stop the app so restarted everything. It's a bit better but still chewing through data (not as bad as before but still much more than previpusly) checked all my emails no massive attachments or anything like that. If it keeps happening I'm offski. I can't afford to keep buying data for my phone

	  Works flawlessly with self-signed TLS1 certificates on my own IMAP server where old Gmail App refused to. User interface has good balance between familiarity -- it looks close enough to Gmail and customizability -- way more mail options are available for tweaking, it is possible to use client certificates instead of passwords.

	  K-9 is installed on my LG Optimus F3 and is configured for an IMAP Email account and a GMAIL account. The synchronization is flawless. Emails arrive within seconds. Polling is turned off! K-9 is an app that you will appreciate more as you learn its features. I've been using it about 6 months. My opening page displays the two accounts where I can select all the Email, just Unread Email, or the IMAP folders. Each account has a different Home key color and sound notification. To be absolutely, sure K-9 was the best for my needs, I evaluated several IMAP Email clients for synchronization, usability, and most importantly, battery drain. K-9 draws the least power; much less than the default Email client that came with the phone. Take some time to understand the setup menus, and you will be rewarded with an Email client that will do a fantastic job.

	   I have used this app for my email for years and it was really good until a few months ago. Since then the performance has been terrible and it crashed multiple times per day. Even doing something as simple as opening an email. This week it has stopped showing new emails. I get notifications that I have new email but when I open the app the newest message in my inbox is from 5 days ago. Please fix these issues or I will have to continue using another app.

	  Works perfectly and is easier than Maildroid to set up. However, if I get (for instance) 10 emails on my gmail account, I also get 10 (sound) notifications. Is it possible to just get one notification no matter how many emails have just arrived?

	<title>Missing some critical features</title>
	<comment>
	   I am trying various email apps, and this is one of the better ones but... no text view for messages, no source view, no encryption support, no html editing on replies or new messages, no calender support, no mark as not-spam... well that is enough. I thought it was more complete based upon the reviews, but it seems the reviewers just don't know any better. I will try it again when those features have been added.

	<title>Its ok, but could be better</title>
	<comment>
	   Its OK, but when an email has a picture or there is more text, you have to press a button to download the picture or another button for the complete text. This almost always never works with out exiting the email which takes you back to the inbox. You then have to reopen the email. Sometimes you have to repeat this process several times before it works. Please fix!!!

	  This is one of the best mail apps out there, however I keep losing draft mails as I'm writing them. If the app loses focus (or whatever the equivalent to 'focus' on android), my new message goes into the nothingness. And this results in me getting frustrated and saying all sorts of curse words. The program should save the draft every while and then (every 30 seconds would be good), and immediately when it loses focus (such as when a call comes). Generally my phone is low on memory, and this is probably what's causing this problem to happen.

	  By far, the best email program on Android. I cleared the data for the Gmail app and disabled it because I much prefer K9. It supports IMAP and multiple accounts better than Gmail or the stock Android mail app.

	  I used to like this app, when I primarily used it in on WiFi. Now that I use it more frequently with Mobile, I've been having a lot of problems -- especially seeing lots of errors when sending email, and other random "Connection Error" when attempting to read a message. Not very happy.

	  I used this app for a really long time, and for the most part it is nice. But I had to axe it after it started sending emails before I finished writing them. I came off as very unprofessional because of this (sending 4+ partially completed emails instead of one is just not clean looking). Also, the settings were a bit troublesome to set up, it definitely took some exploring to get it down.

	<comment>
	   I have been using k9 for over 4 years. All this time it has been very reliable, connected to 7 emails accounts both pop and imap with push notifications. But since upgrading to Lollipop major battery drain issues. Install k9 and my battery is empty in 4 to 5 hours, remove k9 and battery is still at 68% after 11 hours. K9 does not show on battery usage stats but stats for android system jump from 1% to 15% when k9 installed. Giving 5 stars for years of great service. Hoping lollipop issues fixed soon

	   This app crashes, at a minimum, daily. Sometimes it will crash several times per day. My favorite thing is when I get 500 notifications for the same email. Love that. Also, the nice 4 gig burn on my data from the turd running all night was a great surprise. Do yourself a favor and skip this app.

	  The only email client I would trust (open sourced) while also supporting reply email configuration (Reply-To and From fields). If you're finding the other email clients a bit lacking/bare or you're finding it does not allow you to tailor the way you do email, give K9 a go. It hasn't disappointed me so far.

	  When there are images in the body of the message fit to screen makes all the texts of the body very small and the image is full width of the screen. This makes reading the content very difficult since it is so small. I am using Samsung 6 edge. Worked perfectly on Samsung s4. The 250 maximized font size is ignored.

	   I used this app a while back but forgot about it when I switched phones multiple times. I've recently reinstalled it and have to say I'm impressed with the progress. It was already a solid app but it keeps improving. It's clear their developers are very active in continuing to improve usability.

	   I love the interface. It will be my client of choice once I can get it to recognise my openmailbox account. So far username and password come back with errors even though they are correct. Also unfortunately the app can't be moved to SD without total loss of app data

	   In recent months it has developed an annoying habit of mis-reporting the number of new emails. It constantly reported new mail when none existed. I have switched to Type Mail and so far so good.

	   When changing my DPI to anything lower than stock on my Nexus 6 the DPI of K9 doesn't change. This is terrible as I do not like the huge DPI. Also there's still no way to disable the Account Colors on the left which take up screen space.

	  My favourite email client when it comes to customizations, however the seemingly unsolved issues below makes me go for other alternatives : - great drain on battery of almost 60% which reduces battery life while the phone is idle - lots of heat generated from idle phone use - frequent app crashes

	<comment>
	   I moved to K-9 from Typemail because I wanted the ability to send emails from an alias, which you can do with the identity feature. The user interface isn't as nice but it is perfectly acceptable. It does take some effort to set up and it is worth reading the help information from their website particularly about push and pull fetching. I haven't found any problems and I have it set up for three Google accounts. Recommended.

	<comment>
	   The app doesn't walk you through the Archive set up process. If it is not configured by the user you will loose all that you archive due to the fact it creates a Archive folder that is not linked and when you change to link folder or change to different folder it you will loose all in the unlinked Archive folder it created. This issue has been around for many years and they have not addressed it yet 馃槧

	   Update 3... Now crashing almost every time I delete a message either from within the message or from the lost of messages. Update2... Fixed link clicks so they work. Good for most part but seriously annoying when on a daily basis it randomly turns off sync so messages stop being deleted on server. No reason why, just stops. Don't notice till you log in via web and see that hundreds of emails that you thought were deleted are all still sitting there. Waste of time

	<title>Jun2015 horrific batt drain</title>
	<comment>
	   Used on S3min & S4min very pleased for 3 years. June 2015 phone got hot and batt drained in 1 hour. Settings showed K9 responsible. Uninstalled, rebooted, reinstalled. Charged overnight, same thing again. Removed, set Samsung mail up, recharged now working well. Sorry K9, let me know when you have fixed.

	   Since 2012-Sep thru present 2015: (1) Rotating device while in-progress of composing msg ERASES all entries (2) App does not utilize Android clipboard .. can only paste last item copied despite numerous clips available (3) When press fwd on a lengthy email, then press edit, app crops end portion of original body.

	<title>Great email client, but PGP support is lacking</title>
	<comment>
	   All around a great email client. Unfortunately, I need PGP support, and K-9 doesn't support PGP/MIME-encoded messages. That's the only thing holding me back from giving five stars.

	<title>Works OK; interface is outdated.</title>
	<comment>
	   This is a fine choice of e-mail apps, especially because it is open-source and has no ads. The interface is primitive and confusing, but you'll figure it out eventually. I had problems setting up my accounts, but that was my fault for not using the automatic settings.

	<title>Used to love it, but too slow</title>
	<comment>
	   I've used k9 for several years, and generally really liked it. Over the past couple of years, though, it has simply gotten too slow to be functional. Opening a message takes several seconds, as does returning to the message list. I didn't know if it was my phone ( note 2), my server, or k9. I just downloaded aqua, and though I haven't used it enough to know if I actually like it, it seems to do the trick and opens messages quickly.

	   Been using K-9 for years... not because it's the hands-down best mail app (can't say it is) but because they fix issues quickly and nearly always fix them the *first* time. That's rare (sadly). I'll take great support over bells/whistles any day.

	  I am a new convert to Android coming from Blackberry which used to have auto bcc but got rid of it in its latest operational software. Therefore, I appreciate K9 a lot because my work email is Pop 3 so my sent work emails on my phone don鈥檛 show up on my desktop unless I can bcc and your auto bcc does that so I have a complete file of my emails on my desktop at work.

	   Though I have used K-9 Mail for over a year, I'd not posted a review. I'm still using it so what ielse need be said? Well, there is more. I was prompted to post today because they just put out an update for an issue caused by an Android component update. While it took weeks for this response, it now works again for me and in a world where sometimes these updates seem to never come, weeks is pretty good.

	   This app is great! All the functionality of AOSP email and Gmail, and even more! The ability to aet multiple 'from:' addresses is what really sells this app to me. It does look a little odd on Android 5+ though, because it still uses the older Holo design.

	  Used this app to collect iCloud mail and mail from my own personal OSX server on my Nexus handset but it has just stopped receiving mail from both. Tried many different incoming server settings to no avail. Continually fails authentication for incoming mail servers which I know are correct. Used to work with exactly the same settings and I have changed nothing. Prior to issues was a 4* application!

	   Seem a nice email client, but two fatal problems with gmail. It doesn't handle labels fully, and doesn't seem to understand conversations properly. Eg I have a conversation with 23 emails but only two are shown. Labels are treated as folders, which they are not.

	<title>Essential app if you have multiple email accounts</title>
	<comment>
	   This application allows tens of accounts, mixed POP3 and IMAP. I think its the closest one can come to Mozilla Thundebird email client on a tablet or phone. The only things I found missing were 1) the ability to move mails from one IMAP server to another IMAP, 2) the ability to search the subject line separately and more quickly than always searching the entire email text. 3) Filters

	   Liked the app but now things happening such as deleted mail comes back into inbox and I hate this. Should not be happening. Also how do you limit the number of messages in your inbox, I currently have 110 and it is difficult to work with this amount?

	<comment>
	   While K9 supports PGP/Inline for encrypted mail, it doesn't support the better and more widely used PGP/Mime standard. Which makes it utterly useless, since 99% of encrypted emails I receive use the latter.

	   Nexus 4, stock rom (latest) and crashes every time I multi select emails (e.g to bulk delete). Happens on Kaiten (fork) as well, so clearly a major issue with the build and not update for months has fixed it despite constantly sending crash logs. Giving up and moving to type mail.

	<title>Cannot trust any Android mail app</title>
	<comment>
	   ...not even this one, though it seems to be the best of a bad batch. Do not use K-9 if you have more than a few hundred messages in your email system. Kept throwing NULLPointerExceptions, I imagine they were triggered by 'too many' messages. In any case, use of IMAP is hindered, because the app seems to try to read the whole messages prior to showing them in the folder, even if you tell it not to. On a fast internet connection, this was gonna take hours to show the thousands of emails in my inbox. Search options seem limited... search whole messages, or... ? Whole messages then. Other choices were too complex, eg too many options for whether or not to display folders. If I made a folder, display it. Use the alphabet to decide where. Done. Make options for things that matter. Good luck for the future. I uninstalled. Will make post-it note to self as reminder: do not trust a platform for email which is provided by a monopoly who makes their money from reading your email. Q.E.D.

	<comment>
	   Excellent PGP integration, but I have some major qualms with it: Nested folders shows like a relative Unix path, rather than multi-level menus. If there are certificate errors with one of your accounts, it will endlessly flash your LED, regardless of your settings, until you resolve it. It is unclear whether it supports formatting: if I save a draft with links on a format-capable client and open it on K9, it auto converts to BBCode, but doesn't seem to convert it to an HTML message upon sending it.

	<title>Reboot problem</title>
	<comment>
	   I've had the App for years and have been happy with it. Until the Android 5 update on my Note 3. After the update, my phone started crashing/rebooting about once a day. I spent weeks trying to track down the problem. I did a reset on my phone and re-installed my critical Apps and the problem was still present. It would happen even when the phone was sitting on charge overnight. I called AT&T, and they admitted that this was one of the problems they were seeing since the Android 5 update but all they could offer was a $100 phone replacement with no guarantee that this was solve the problem. Then I realized that it often happened when I was checking my email with K9. I removed K9, rebooted my phone, and it has only crashed once in the last 7 days. So, while there may be an underlying problem with Android 5, it becomes a critical problem with K9 installed.

	   I've used K-9 for 4 years without any problems, first on my Samsung Moment and now on my new phone. Works great! Custom settings very useful. Always notifies me when I have new mail. You can have it check (poll) for new mail constantly or once a day; change poll settings to longer time to save battery life. My fave email app out of the three I use.

	   So I can decrypt my mail with the help of APG, but sending mail is a nightmare (aka doesn't work). In my opinion, being able to send and email from an email app is important, but that may just be me.. UPDATE: uninstalled... Got too fed up with the constant "failed to send" notifications

	   Works great with Gmail. Not so well with hotmail/live. Instead of deleting messages it will just mark them as read. Seems to be a common issue in most email clients.

	<title>Doesn't play well with std sync</title>
	<comment>
	   By not using std android sync features, there's no way I can trigger a manual sync unless I open the app. This is pretty useless to me. Use case. "Data is on, but android auto sync is off, i press a button manually to sync Everything on my phone ( calendars, etc). No notification appears from k9 about new email. I open k9 and presto, there it is." It is disappointing to see so many good reviews about this product that ignores basic android systems. Note. I don't poll, I don't background auto sync.

	<comment>
	   Recently I noticed that when I read an email it gets moved to the bottom under other unread emails, taking them out of order by date until all emails are read. Update: It seems that the latest update set the sort order to read/unread instead of date like I used to have.

	<comment>
	   I often have a lot to say about things lacking in features or the GUI, but not here. It took a bit to find the desired settings, but I eventually found everything I was looking for, including replyto. On my Moto E 2ndGen 4GLTE under Lollipop 5.02, I like the single button review (skip, marking as read, or delete) of email, including the landscape split, and it appears nice on cell data (and use WiFi) once was told to restrict in background like other apps need. We'll see, when ads start appearing. The only tiny downside I have is that the notifications should be in color (rather than boring B&W) and should refer to K-9 rather than generic email. That's all I have, and it ain't much negative --> 5*. Maybe more later...

	   I use it with 3 accounts Hotmail, Gmail and GMX, all with IMAP, substituting the stock email and Gmail too. No problems or issues. The fact that I use it quickly faded into the background, as befits a good application with many available alternatives. Being open source implies less lossage, pretense, bullshit, nagging, and no promotion nor in-app selling.

	   The problem with the app is that when refreshing email it frequently gets stuck polling a folder. This was draining my battery a lot so I changed it to check for messages only when I manually do so. I often have to close the app, restart it then hit refresh again to get my email. A bug that hid messages behind white recently was fixed according to release notes. Nexus 4 w/ lollipop

	   I've been using this mail client for years, and it was phenomenal. However about 2 or 3 updates ago, it started crashing when opening certain messages or only displaying a tiny piece of the message, with the rest of the screen just a blank white space. More recent updates have changed and tweaked this problem, but they haven't managed to kill it yet, making the app very hard to use for productivity purposes. Back to webmail for me, and will give 5 stars once the app is stable again!!

	<title>Good for getting email but not sending</title>
	<comment>
	   I don't have much problem with this app as far as checking my mail. It does a good job receiving them. But what really bothers me is every time I try to send mail it gives me the error "some messages not sent". Really annoying. I have to use the android email to send a message. Android email doesn't work good for receiving mail, that is why I got K9, but I have to use it to send mail.

	   This is a sane email client, does what it says in the tin very well, does not try to create a "unique new experience", just tries to be a good email client, and succeeds at it. Give it a try, it is worth it.

	<title>No Widget?</title>
	<comment>
	   The missing 2 starts were for no widget and no swipe to delete messages. You tick the checkbox to choose multiple messages to delete, move or copy. That is good. Overall it was a good mail client as it allows many customization where default Gmail app can't provide, such as theme, font size etc.

	   On 3 of my Samsung s4s, I did the lollipop update and now the k9 mail does load emails in full. To make it work you need to pinch and zoom into the email and zoom back it and then it works, please fix as soon as possible thank you

	<comment>
	   Now that I have Lollipop installed on my S5, k-9 doesn't display emails properly. Most of the time it shows them as blank. I have to return to inbox and reopen the email 2-3 times in order to read the message. This applies to all emails that I receive.

	<comment>
	   I have been using K-9 mail for a long time now. It's pretty useful and light. However, there are some problems with syncing deleted emails. Also, often the entire email body doesn't show at the first go. This happens even when the message size is lower than the download size limit. Going back and opening that email often works, sometimes after multiple attempts.

	   Tapping the star on the right hand side in list view will cause the list to scroll. Also, progress bar when downloading an attachment would be welcome. Half the time I get the impression nothing is happening, and often nothing actually is...nevermind guys, switched to AquaMail, it's like moving from 2006 to 2015. It was nice while it lasted.

	   The worst part of getting a new phone or tab is having to add all your email addresses back in. I have a lot. With K9 I can back the accounts up, with a file manger I put them on google drive and then import to my new device. Only wish I could export directly to a cloud account.

	<title>the best - if only PGP/MIME was supported</title>
	<comment>
	   I've been a K9-mail user for many years and it has served me extremely well, but in a post-Snowden world supporting reasonable and end-user friendly encryption standards is mandatory. Unfortunately after many years of debate, PGP/MIME support is still missing from K9-mail because the developers still don't reagard this as a major missing feature in the application.

	   Suggestion - please create an option to Exit/Stop the app without going to 'Running Apps'. But when network is UP it starts again. So please consider an OFF/STOP option and to stay that way unless we start the app again.

	<title>K9 not so good any longer, slow now!</title>
	<comment>
	   I've used this email app for several years and it was okay. But lately on my LG G3 with latest android update 5.0x it is very slow opening and displaying my emails. When I open an email the contents don't display right away. It sits there for awhile and then the contents pop up finally. Sometimes it doesn't display at all until I scroll to the next email and then back again to force it to reload. ALSO annoying flaw is that there doesn't seem to be any way to restore deleted emails if you deleted by mistake!

	   If you have a slow CPU and not a lot of memory, or if you just like to do a lot of switching back and forth between programs/tasks, K-9 is the lightest and quickest. Or if you have a fast device with a lot of memory to spare, K-9 is best in functionality. And it's FREE. With NO ADS. Ha!

	<title>Bug/request:Ability to reduce sync duration without losing old emails</title>
	<comment>
	   Can you make sync server deletions only effect current sync period. I want to initially sync all. Then reduce sync period to today and enable sync server deletions and want to still have all my mail offline too. This will save my data plan.

	   This is a good, but not great, email app. The fact that it's open source AND free is why I use it. UPDATE: Oh hell no! It's eating emails... Basically it doesn't sync properly. Now I'm afraid how much could be lost due to it.

	   I love this app but recently I have had problems where different emails, html or text will show as blank messages. Sometimes I can quit the app and go back in and it will show the email and sometimes it won't. I have had problems when I am on Wifi or on mobile service. Only common denominator is K9. :( I will change once this gets resolved as I have full cofidence that the will fix the problems with the recent update.

	   Very customizable. I was able to turn off the stupid looking colored balloons next to each contact! Who wants that? This is my business phone, not my 3 yr olds The font size is adjustable for each and every section! Brings mail from several accounts into one stream if you want, which I do. Can select multiple emails at once for deletion. What drove me here was Android on my Nexus 6 forcing me to use Gmail. Not a fan of it. Delete one email at a time? Are you crappin me? I think they pioneered the new terrible look of flat 0 definition graphics with very ugly colors. MS followed as did most other like lemmings into the sea.It's these fat coke bottle glass nerds designing this crap. No artistic ability or creativity left. Like designing these new phones that need braille put on to find the buttons there so thin and flush. I'm done! for now. But this mail app is perfect!

	   I used to use this app all the time for my email needs. Its great except now that I got a smart watch a few months ago, k9 does not give the option to delete an email on my watch. I probably need that more than mark read and reply. so I'm stuck on cloud magic until they could add this feature.

	<comment>
	   Updated review 3 to 1 star. These flaws grate on me every time I use k9. Just copying text is a lesson in frustration and if you can manage to do it, you can't paste it anywhere! Want to add an email addy to your contacts? Good luck. Manually typing it in is your only option. I don't understand why, after how many years, you still haven't incorporated/improved these functions. I give up. You're never going to do it. I found Type Mail now. Sooo much better. What a relief to not fight my email app.

	   Have never been able to setup this app. What address is it asking for? No matter what address I enter it won't work. If the app needs a pop3 address why isn't a drop down menu provided since it's the same for everyone using gmail.

	   This was a great email client, I needed something that could send plain text when needed, but html the rest of the time. In the last couple of weeks it started to hang up when checking mail and when scrolling through a mailbox or even in an email. I keep getting do you want to quit the app isn't responding messages, in rapid succession. I had this on my old device and have it on my Samsung Galaxy S3 now. I am about to ditch it, especially since I don't need plain text anymore.

	   k9 keeps your ID inside the app, doesn't add it to the Android's account space, in other words no other snoopy app can see and misuse it, wonderful

	   Tried logging in with Gmail (why isn't this automated?), get an error message with the plain error message. No formatting. Error States that I need application specific password. So this app cannot handle two factor Auth. Bye.

	<title>The best Mail app even today</title>
	<comment>
	   I have used K9 for several years. I got very excited when Microsoft release the new Outlook Preview. It is slick, and extremely user friendly. Pretty soon I discovered all that looks good is not necessarily great. I don't want to write about that app here, but I evaluated everything from Mailbox, to the new outlook, to the most recent version of Gmail with combined inbox. Honestly, I keep on going back to K9. Nothing beats the flexibility and functionality. It may not be the 'sexiest' UI, but hey, it really does everything I need and more. I manage multiple accounts, - including IMAP.

	   I have tried so many email clients to organize my Gmail, Yahoo and Hotmail accounts, this one is by far the best. This may not be the fastest, but no other app comes close to the options this one provides.

	   I like the fact that it deals with gmail push email as well as third party PGP addons. IF you want full gmail style conversation views where you see your own sent email with their replies, go into the settings and set the "Sent" to go to the inbox, else all you will see are the emails that are sent to you and you never see your own replies in the conversation view.

	   Glitchy, with deleting messages, but a small price to pay...issues on k-@.. are worse... So many email apps.. This one does everything I need it to, for free ,and does it well... And without. Ads.... And compromised security like mymail. Leaves my messages on the server when I delete from the phone... Works soso with cloudprint. I have ten or so email accounts and I can't waste time with buggy crap. As far as I can see, nothing compares to k9.

	   I really like the simple design. You can view multiple email accounts at once. However I wish this app have a selection when you delete email if you just want to delete the email on the device or both on the device and serve. I usually opt for the first one because I need the get updates fron emails as often +fast as I could and when that's done I don't want the thousands of emails weighing down my phone.I don't want to delete them forever in case I'll be needing them in the future. Pls consider adding this

	  I really liked this app and would have given it a 5 a couple of months ago. However something happened and it Uninstaller itself and when I reinstalled it, I couldn't get my AOL accounts set up again. I keep trying to remove and set them up again without any luck. Hopefully there will be another update that will correct this.

	<comment>
	   I didn't manage to save attachments on SD card . Apparently on Android 4.4 third party apps do not have rights to write on secondary external device -SD card. That is why all of the mail clients have this limitation - except google-made of course.

	   I have used this email app for years now. Used it for the first time on the original Moto Droid, now using on LG G3. This app works better than any stock email apps that come on your phones. App keeps getting better with each version, absolutely love it! Will continue to use it for many more years to come.

	<comment>
	   I've been using K9 for a long time now with no major complaints. I love being so in control with the variety of settings. Only 2 things prevent 5 stars: 1) IMAP accounts often report old unread messages as new and throw notifications. 2) Without the ability to copy settings from one account to another, setting up new accounts just how you want them can be tedious.

	   I've got it working smoothly--polling and notifications included--with Yahoo, Outlook, and Gmail. The only major glitch is that I can't get it to work with Tesla Unread. Pro Tip: If you're using 2-step verification, don't forget to enter your app-specific password.

	<comment>
	   Works well for multiple accounts. Can set notifications/polling for each individual account. Can export all account settings to a new device which is very convenient if managing multiple accounts with different domains. As good or better than any email client I have used on any OS.

	<comment>
	   need spam filtering but was the 1 of the only email clients I could find that allowed you to select all messages and delete them at once. Update: it's a year later and K9 still holds the crown for features, compatibility, and performance. Update: vicious bug with 5.1 Lollipop-selecting a message (or messages) crashes the app! The dog walkers fixed this within a few hours. Wow!

	<comment>
	   Due to its dark theming option K9 is my goto android email app. Unfortunitely on Android v5.1.0 K9 force closes anytime one or more emails are seleted from the left side list (check box). All other funtionality appear to work. This is true both on my Nexus 10 and 5 now that they run Android v5.1 while K9 did not have any issues with Android v5.0.2, hopefully this will be fixed soon.

	   The email app itself does what it is supposed to do, and does it quite well. All I really have to say that lacks in this app is material design. I know this project is open source though, so perhaps someone will step up and commit code to change the UI.

	   To me, this looks very much like Gmail's app, but then the ui is totally different. I'm not the biggest fan of Gmail's looks in the first place, and the extra confusion just made it not worthwhile. I love the K9 pic; it reminds me of Doctor Who, but I still had to uninstall.

	   Great light app that's smooth and effective. Had Outlook before, but it was so slow and buggy. K9 would be the ultimate app if only you had the option of compressing pictures when attaching. Emails become way too large when attaching pictures uncompressed. Please can you add that feature?

	   If only this application will allow you to set notification times for each individual account. As it stands right now you can only do this for the entire application and not for an individual account. I am a system administrator and want to be alerted during normal business hours of all communications but only wish to receive communications from my alerts email account when I'm asleep. this is a really big deal for me. I'm sure I'm not alone.

	<title>THE BEST alternative to stock email app!</title>
	<comment>
	   This app is fast, stable, and feature-rich. One star withheld due to a bit too many account-specific settings instead of global ones, but that's more a personal preference. Totally usurps the slow, flaky stock email app. In fact, Android engineers should punt their app and use K-9 (or at least its code) for future OS releases. It's THAT good.

	   One of the best email apps available, but too many unnecessary permissions. USB storage? I'm not rooted nor carrying any OTG. START AT STARTUP: Even Microsoft give more control. I love it, my battery hates it. I'll keep an eye on the change log and decide what to do.

	   Free opensource software, no ads, very fast and useful, with lots of configuration you can edit. Very good support for gmail and other e-mails. Strong recommend! The best e-mail app for Android I ever tried!

	<title>Functional but....</title>
	<comment>
	   Tried it due to having at least 4 email accounts and want something to wrap it all in one. Just can't find a way to like it. Not sold on the layout and really hate the polling deal for notifications. I've legitimately lost emails when I should have at a certain time. Just can't do it. Probably good for others though.

	<comment>
	   This was a 5 star app. It's now fairly 3.5 stars but going with 3 because it's definitely not a 4. The app is a battery killer. Not always, but some days I'll pick up my phone and it's abnormally warm and the battery life is unusually low. Then when I check my battery stats K9 is going bonkers every time. Otherwise it's a fine app but I can't afford to have my email app suck my battery dry and leave me without juice. FIX THIS! (Galaxy Note 3)

	<title>Upgraded to Blue Mail</title>
	<comment>
	   K-9 takes hours to send one picture and one sentance over a 20mbps+ connection. Abuses wakelocks which drains battery. Can't complete simple actions like deleting emails. Any mail you accidentally delete is gone forever because you "can't move or copy messages not synchronized with the server". Blue mail is faster and actually works! Don't waste your time or energy on this p.o.s

	<title>better than default droid email app</title>
	<comment>
	   This app is good for managing your email. One of its strengths is being able to empty your trash in bulk. However one of my issues is that one of my email accounts will not allow me to send. When trying to set up, the application bombs. I end up having to send out another email account because one can not get set up completely.

	<title>Last version upgrade is awful</title>
	<comment>
	   I used to love this app, now I hate it. With the latest version it freezes constantly and takes forever to load mail folders. It crashes and doesn't remove deleted items from the inbox until I exit and go back into the app. Sometimes only new mail is displayed in the inbox, other times all the mail with no rhyme or reason. Very frustrating since it was much better.

	   I liked how it used 10mb of memory compared at others in the 30mb range. But it does not download the complete messages or pics. I have to manually tap on download and then wait. Sometimes pics still won't download.

	<comment>
	   I like the app, but I receive an error message saying "Failed to send some messages" EVERY time I send an email. I then have to go to the Outbox & press the refresh button a couple of times in order for the email to successfully send. This happens every time I send an email. Every time! Btw, you're getting a lot of negative reviews from users. What gives?

	   Update: Recently, when selecting one mail from the list, the another one opens... Fix it, please. Overall, the best mail app. The welcome addition would be a single notification when checking multiple accounts via unified inbox and swipe to delete in mail lists. Besides, great mail client, keep working :-)

	   Not a bad app, but it is buggy. I frequently am unable to see my email, just a white box instead of the message. Sometimes playing with the theme settings will fix it but its not worth the hassle every time I want to check my email.

	   went over to Gmail for a while, like the newer UI. But it throws huge amounts of data on my limited dinosaur and even with that, is slow. Finally, too many problems with Play services so back to K-9. K-9's two stage downloading is most effective, quick, efficient. UI could use a good update, but as-is, very usable and friendly.

	   Being able to manually set the color code for each account. The color wheel is awesome but setting a manual color code can allow us to use a more specific color we want :)

	   This is a great app. Much better than the version that came pre-installed on my tablet. You can have multiple email adresses, forward emails, (plus c.c. and b.c.c) and organise things in colour coded folders. I use it a lot for work and I would highly recommend it.

	   This app was awesome easy to use, reliable, etc until recently. Now it wont delete emails on the server, all the settings are set to delete from the server, the app just refuses to delete. Maybe its the device or a new rule with the cell provider - - so I'll give it 3 stars -- it used to be 5 stars

	<comment>
	   I manage figuring out how to add 2nd email account, but it wasn't easy. Not that this app does work on a Nexus 7 running Android Lollypop (5.0.2). It's just that you have to manually add each email account you want to use like you did with the basic 'Email's app. It gets complicated after that if you want to add multiple email accounts.

	<comment>
	   But there's something I'd love: Either give me an option to stop seeing notifications if I'm connected to a certain wifi network, or stop notifications on certain times. If I'm at home, I see my mails anyways, so hearing the notification sounds all the time is bothering and a bit pointless. I would love to disable them when I'm connected to my home wifi.

	<comment>
	   Good app except I want to have all my emails stored on my external SD card. Yes, I know there's an option to store to the external card, and I have it switched on, but on my phone, internal storage is called sdcard0 and the external card is called sdcard1. K-9 does not seem to be able to differentiate between the two, and, thus, over a gig of emails are being stored internally and taking up valuable space. There needs to be an option to let the user specify the storage path.

	   I like it ok (although sometimes everything but unread messages disappear and I have no idea why...they come back eventually.) Could you add a filter where I would receive a notification for emails from certain senders? (E.g. my boss) Love having all my accounts in one place - thanks!!

	<comment>
	   It's great. I always use the conversation view on my Outlook, and whenever I replied via my Samsung default mailapp, it make a new conversation instead of continuing the previous one. However, K9 did this flawlessly. I just need to BCC my email so that I can download it to my outlook. I hope that the visual can match the gmail soon. Good job, K9 Team!

	   I'm trying to add to k-9 a new gmail I created couple of month ago, I made sure email and password are correct , but every time I try to add account I get this error msg "Username and password incorrect. Command: authenticate plain response; #2# [no [ authentication failed " etc... , and I received email from Google saying they blocked access cause the app is using less secure authentication, and they did it so I be protected by modern security standards , and that if I allowed it I'd be easier to attack , please fix this asap

	   I like K9, but I keep coming and going with it. The only real problem is that server side search isn;t working with Yahoo. It works with Gmail however. If this was fixed, I could just delete the rest. Support unread notifications and fully customisable. I'll hold back that last star until Yahoo server side search is working,

	   Used for over a year but it never actually worked right. Using SMTP it would occasionally notify me of new emails that weren't there (usually after deleting emails). Using IMAP it would never delete messages from the server, even when flagged to do so in settings. The interface is also dated and boring. There are a lot nicer products out there to try, I ended up going with MyMail.

	  Only works 50% of the time, the rest is certificate errors! Been using this app for years now, but it's been a mess ever since the lollipop update, and it doesn't look to be improving! Might have to switch to another app :(

	<title>Screen draw difficulties under Lollipop.</title>
	<comment>
	   I really like K9 Mail, and bugs are usually solved quickly. Ever since the upgrade to Lollipop on my LG G3 I have the problem that some (quite a high percentage though) emails appear to have no body (except for a tiny, truncated line at the top). I have to rotate my phone to force the screen to redraw, which makes the email render correctly. When I rotate the phone back, the email renders as it is supposed to. If I use the phone sideways, it happens just as well, so I still have to rotate the phone.

	   I actually like this mail app. But when i wanted to transfer data to new phone there are no options and it seems the app data folders seems to be hidden from the user. So this app becomes useless to me.

	<title>SPAM option doesn't work</title>
	<comment>
	   Would be nice if you could mark emails as SPAM. Sure, you can mark ONE email as SPAM at a time, but eventually that option disappears. This app could be great, but they've taken something simple and turned it into something overly complex that doesn't really work. Don't waste your time with this app.

	<title>Disappointing</title>
	<comment>
	   I was expecting a host of features based on the reviews, however when it comes to actually writing emails, it's as featureless as the stock Gmail app (and without the pretty design). You can't format text - i.e. No bold/italic/underline etc. Not even some simple bullet points or indenting. In summary, you can write some words and you can attach a file. That's about it. Exactly what the Gmail app does.

	   Perfect mailer for dealing with non-standard email servers. Tons of options for a nearly every configuration. The only issue I have is in printing via share. Mail with html tags sends as text to the target app. Please add a ''send as Image" or "Pre render" feature. Currently screen capture is the only (unoptimal) work around.

	<title>An important effort worth donating to.</title>
	<comment>
	   If you separate all the problems caused by particular hardware and Android implementations, you will see that this email client, though not perfect-because there is no such thing- has no equal. With options such as: Local and sync server deletions, Cc/Bcc ,Receipts, Cryptographic options, Message format option, no ads, power, control, and much more. All it needs is for you to learn how to use it. I have been using it for a very long time and have always found work arounds for the unexpected quirks generated by the ware and tear of its use. Kind of feel like the stuff of a serious, powerful mail client that puts you in control doesn't it? That is because it is, and it shows what dedicated people in the open source community are able to do for us. They deserve our admiration. Excellent work.

	   Still the best e-mail app out there. Add a Set Priority option (please, please, please!) and it would be plain perfect. :)

	   Does everything Gmail can AND you can actually search your emails with it too! I have tried lots of different clients and found this is the best one by far! What others can't do, K-9 does!

	   This is such a great and wonderful peace of software. Too many good things for this little space. Personally, the fact that the 'stars' feature is compatible with Thunderbird and Gmail, and selection of an 'archive' folder makes it a killer-app. Well done, guys!

	<comment>
	   Very good app. As a programmer I needed to have some special processing done to incoming email. I did it on the stock email app but had to compile the whole Android to get it. So I switched to K-9. Very well designed app. In a couple of hours I had the app modified for my needs and ready to be used. This tells a lot on the quality of the code. Congratulation for your great work!

	  I'm using this app for almost 4 years. It has almost everything. But recently, especially after upgrading to lollipop, it started to eat up all the resources. Drains battery and last month it used around 2gb data in the background. Hope this use will be resolved soon.

	<comment>
	   Supports IMAP push, which is an absolute must for those of us who refuse to trust Google and similar big boys with their email.Giving it four stars instead of five because there is room for improvement. Sometimes seems to drop network connectivity and not reconnect. The configuration for how the various folders should be synchronised is too complicated and impossible to understand for mere humans. Still a great app, and there is no real competition at present.

	<comment>
	   Earlier I gave this app a bad review because I thought it had bad support for bottom-posting. Turns out that I was missed the "Sending mail" menu in "Account Settings". Some things I'd like to see: 1) Something in the blurb on the Play Store that this app supports real bottom-posting. 2) The /more/ proper quoted text prefix is "> ", that is a greater-than followed by a space. 3) When I have "Reply after quoted text" checked, it would be nice if I could see the bottom of the quoted text while I compose my reply. Perhaps toggle between current behavior (composing on top, yet showing up on bottom) and this suggested behavior.

	<comment>
	   K9 may be the best mailer on android, but that's a low bar, and the main reason I only use the phone or tablet for really urgent stuff. Not having hierarchical folder views is a throwback to the pre Unix days, not made for serious users. Also, K9 frequently hangs until some timeout, taking ages to pull in mail (I don't use push mail). Forcing stop and restarting makes it work normally again (for a while).

	<comment>
	   Downloaded the app mid-dec 2014 and it works great with my Yahoo mail account. I decided to try K-9 because my android defat email client was REALLY frustrating (deleted emails would suddenly reappear). Never had problems with K-9, and when setting up my account it was able to know the incoming/outgoing yahoo server settings.

	<title>Best Email App yet</title>
	<comment>
	   The developers of this app did a great job. It works in the way I'm used to with Outlook, which is great. I tried a lot of email apps, and this one is the best. Thank You.

	<title>Delete Emails keep coming back. Problem still occurring 5 months after I deleted this app!</title>
	<comment>
	   Why can't the developer fix a simple but annoying problem? I left K9 in July because of a major problem鈥攄eleted Emails constantly all come back en masse! It doesn't matter what I do, because every time I delete Emails, whenever new ones arrive, ALL the old deleted ones reappear. I delete them again; they come back again! I've given up on this flawed app.

	<comment>
	   K-9 is great for the way I use it, with several imap accounts and numerous folders. Even gets sent mail to the right folder on the right server. That's a lot of configuring, and then I make sure to back up the configuration. Restoring the configuration works beautifully.... Each time K-9 loses its cinfiguration it offers a button for restoring a saved cinfiguration and you get to pick the file you want to restore from. When it doesn't lose configurations any more then i'll give that fifth star. :-o

	<comment>
	   Been using this app for years, mostly because when I started using it, it was the best available. I still like, it but want to see 2 or 3 additional functions to give it 5 stars: 1. Swipe to right to delete (from inbox), 2. Swipe to left for additional messaging options (from inbox), 3. MS Outlook Exchange 2010 compatibility.

	<comment>
	   Another application that worked brilliantly and was incredibly versatile. but is now broken and so buggy that it's unusable. If you have access to an older version use that. Unlikely that the security compromises will hit you in the older version but certain that the new bugs will make you delete the app altogether. A real pity. Author: Do some basic testing yourself before release. Don't rely on your bug tracker. How did you manage to get such a brilliant app written in the first place with that attitude. Sticking to the older version.

	<comment>
	   Every since the last Android 5 update Gmail will only allow emails grouped in conversations. I hate that, especially when I have a ton of emails along the same thread...meaning get lost and out of order. Tried several email apps hoping to turn 'conversation view' off. K9 allows that. I'm a customer for life because they understand busy business needs

	   Simple and complete. Easy setup of POP accounts. Checks the validity of the outgoing and incoming setups as soon as they are done. I found it much better than the dreadful Motorola email and GMail. No adds and free. Thanks to the developers. It does work with Yahoo POP accounts (it is necessary, as often with Yahoo on any email client, to check on the web which are the better ports to use: as they vary).

	<title>Problems galore with Lollipop</title>
	<comment>
	   K9 was the best solution (especially) for people with multiple E-mail accounts both on Android Jellybeans and KitKat versions. I recently upgraded to Lollipop on my Google Nexus 5 and that's when my problems started and only grown since. I perceive a general problem with syncing both whilst sending out and receiving mails. Also I mostly get mails in clusters and that too after rebooting. Some mails, I fear, get lost in transit. URGENT upgrade mandatory to sustain it's utility and thereby retain clientele.

	   The only e-mail client out there with an option to save mails to external storage.That's great guys,you rule,love it. Still I don't see the reason why you don't put any effort into creating some useful widget (really not a great deal) so that the app could be used in a splendid manner... I'd even pay for someone who does both of the things(sd card+widget) still ...

	   Turns out my gmail was blocking a suspicious login attempt. So far so good, though a suggestion of mine is to change the way to select emails. Swiping works, but is inefficient for large amounts of mail. When you click on the little circle, it allows you to create a contact. This function could be in the context menu, and be replaced with a way to select mail, because how often in comparison will you add contacts as opposed to select mail?

	   The options on this app are incredible. Beautiful... I have 2 issues though: (1) I still experience issues with server searches on Outlook. The mails that I seek are found, but not displayed. (2) Starred mails should be displayed without being limited by a time frame or the number of mails that I keep on my device. I keep just 25 mails on my device. If a starred mail is the 26th, it is dropped from the starred mail count and not displayed.

	<comment>
	   YOU CAN NO LONGER USE K9 FOR MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS. USELESS! Latest update tinged the look of K9. Too busy! Ugh. More often than not texts come in reverse order, short texts are split into multiples unnecessarily, and longer texts sent are received in jibberish and cannot be read. UNACCEPTABLE.

	   I'm a huge android fan and I'm on my phone literally 16 hours a day. The only thing I always missed about my iPhone 3g from 5 years ago was its beautiful email client implementation and today for the first time ever since, I've seen email working flawlessly on an android device. Period. The native gmail and email clients on kit kat including all patches as of Nov 21 2014 is really awful. I'm so happy I took time to search the app store and went with this email client. Cheers to the developers!

	   I don't know where to start. I was expecting a working open source client and it's not. Threaded view doesn't work, configuration is a nightmare, but the worst is Battery life. I used to get 1.5 to 2 days of moderate usage out of my G2, now I get about 8h tops, without even using it!!! Keeps the cpu awake like a maniac (I'm talking tens of thousands of wakelocks, every day with only 2 barely used imap accounts). It's just not usable.

	   It worked for 2 years. Just crashed and will not connect to server to recognize accounts. No gmail, no aol, and besides no reply button in landscape which was very annoying. Get mymail app or bluemail, both considerably better. K-9 is officially an obsolete dinosaur.

	   I use this app for my Hotmail. ..on Samsung Galaxy Note3. I really really like it....very reliable. The only issue I've had lately is when I have a sent email that fails to Send and go through...due to wrong address or something. ..it CONTINUOUSLY trues to resend it just to fail. I have had to Uninstall app 3 times now due to this to stop that transaction from continuing. Other than that I'm happy with it!

	   Since updating to Android 5 (Lollipop), K9 will no longer send mail with my iCloud account. I get an "com.fsck.k9.mail.CertificateValidationException: Handshake failed" error in the log. My Gmail accounts work just fine***, but I'm fairly certain the problem is with K9 because the Gmail app sends mail on my iCloud account just fine. When it's working, this is a great app -- PLEASE FIX IT! ***EDIT: it's started giving me certificate errors on my Gmail accounts as well now.

	   I've tried other clients and al be it they look pretty but they all have one problem, they lack functionality, I have not come across another program yet where I can pull up the headers. Sure you get a senders name but that's it, where's the detail, where did this email originate from? And that's the problem with every other program I've tried.

	   The only redeeming feature is that it syncs... sometimes. Hard to learn and I'm not an idiot. Moved to Blue Mail... MUCH BETTER. With k9 mail you have to configure the outgoing settings with charter accounts.

	<title>Lost all my messages</title>
	<comment>
	   I've been using this app for a few years now with my pop mail account. ( My provider does not offer IMAP ) A few days ago it crashed, and when I restarted it all 900+ messages were gone. Not happy about the glaring lack of a backup procedure for messages!

	<comment>
	   I have been using the app for a while and it is the best I have used. Two things I wish that it had: 1) swipe to delete like gmail and solmail and 2) access to a reply button when you are reading an email in landscape mode.

	   This is the best email app I could find. Not the prettiest but functional. Plus: quiet time is a function that more apps should have. This is the reason I don't use the all new gmail app. Niggles: emails are often displayed in miniature font which makes them impossible to read. On some accounts, such as yahoo, emails don't get deleted when I delete them with the app.

	<comment>
	   When I installed K-9 Mail on my HUAWEI Honor smartphone, I never intended to make it as the main way of my email correspondences. But with all its main functionalities that serve as a push-email notification and a sender on-the-go, I was in for a pleasant surprise! A feature worth mentioning is a setting for all outgoing messages to be blind-copied to my own email address so I can always have them later filed in my Sent folder on my PC, making them no different from those sent directly from PC.

	<comment>
	   I also see a significant (56%) increase in battery usage on ver 5.000. The fact it is being reported in ver 5.001 suggests upgrading are not going to fix it. The issues expressed by others make me think updating should be avoided at this time. The reply button does not appear in landscape mode.

	<comment>
	   This app doesn't have the high security protocols to connect to Gmail. You have to set your Google Gmail account to a less secure setting to let this app connect. If you do that anyone and anything can try and access your account without you knowing it. So don't use this app.

	   It would be great if you can add more "feedback" for the user. For example there is no information when a search result is empty. You could just state this or show a nice picture which helps to understand the case.

	   I've been big fan and recommended k9 to many folks, especially for imap users, but the latest version has been deleting dozens of email everyday. Not moving them to trash or spam, DELETING THEM. Completely gone from the server as well. Even when delete from server options are all turned off. No longer can I trust the app.

	<title>Best email client (features, speed and value) I have come across</title>
	<comment>
	   While it does not have features like rich text message composition / signatures or a flashy appearance (thanks!!) it does the job that a proper email application should. Not only that but the UI is very intelligently thought out especially when it comes to multiple select-deletes, or forwarding emails, and it also easily allows me to send a reply from any of my email accounts. It is also pretty lightweight and fast. After reading some of the reviews of problems after v.5.0x, I had to go and see what I had and I do have 5.001 which works just fine for me. I have maybe 7 accounts (2 of which are IMAP) and all get handled well. The 5th star will be given when it supports rich text composition (as an option) and when it looses the dumb dog icon - never did like that. Keep up the good work!

	   K-9 trashes the viewed message upon exiting the program without returning to the inbox folder first. I kept losing messages to trash until I realized this was happening. Running on Samsung Galaxy Note2 with latest Android OS.

	   Overall good app. I have the folloeing issues though: I get 'connot send' send errors in a loop since I once had a send error, the msg ia in the notifications but it is too long to read and for some reason it is not in the app's 'error' folder. The other issue is that there is no way to select multiple emails, you eather select all or one. Implement it like in gmail's app pls.

	   Was a great app, used for over a year without a problem; latest update trashed everything - emails being deleted before read, each sync deleting the previous mails. Moved to blue mail. Times like this where I wouldn't have minded paying for the app to get better support.

	<title>One of the nicest looking email programs if you like dark theme</title>
	<comment>
	   For 90% of my email, this works great using the dark theme. But for one type, it just won't work (it used to, but either the app changed a while back, or the sender changed formats). For example, I get email promotions from Fry's Electronics that has images for the special deals. With this app, using the dark theme, they are all totally blank. I can click on one, and be taken to the web page via the browser, but that's a pain, and I can't even tell what it is first. Using the light theme works fine. I've tried both "show pictures" and "download complete message", but neither one works for these images. I'd enter a bug report, but they make it too hard to do unless you know exactly what the cause is. I can provide an example, but I don't know why it happens because most email looks fine. It's probably something to do with the email source. I tried another email app with a dark theme, and it behaved the same way.

	   I absolutely love K9 Mail. It's great for using multiple email accounts on the go. My favorite feature is the ability to customize the notification light on compatible devices. My only complaint is that it's not compatible with multi-window mode.

	   I tried to set up smtp for multiple accounts, but they all failed. I tried putting in full email and username only. I tried different ports. I tried different authentications. It might just be my phone (galaxy s4). I also tried searching the bug reporter. I wanted to post a bug report, but it wasn't clear how to go about it. I'll try it again in the future, but for now I've wasted too much time.

	<comment>
	   Have reverted to a backup of v4 as smtp send appears to be broken in v5 (SSL/TLS certificate problem) and still not fixed in 5.001 update. Have used K9 for years now so hope this will be fixed soon as I'd like to stick with it.

	   After the latest update my K9 became slow on opening the app, opening messages and changing folders. Now the screen usually blanks and turns black for a few seconds before the app or message opens. Note 3. Please address this, other than this 5 stars, especially if you added EAS.

	   Lots of options which is always a good thing. I'd ideally like to swipe to delete emails though, and have also noticed if you tap Reply in the notification, you still have to drag up notifications manually when it should automatically dismiss notifications the moment you tap the Reply button. Otherwise good job!

	   Quick scrolling in messages list lagging quite bad, even in phones with so many cores, outrageous RAM & lots of storage space. Super slow when searching old mail in online folder. When an inbox is open, new mail come & opened not from notification, the notification wont go away until manually cleared or reopen mail by tapping the notification. Deleting mail directly from notification causes screen to unlock. Fixes & improvements will be highly anticipated.

	<comment>
	   Great app really brought back alot of features that were lost from earlier Android mail. Really easy to setup and touch wood not a single crash from this gem. Bad: I am using this for 3 email accounts on my home screen but I can't change the name of the home screen link. All show k-9 mail, could do with renaming feature. Also all other mail apps tend to show the number of unread emails on the icon this doesn't. Lastly, no feedback option within the app to say this stuff!?

	   I use this email app regularly to help me manage two email accounts. Since one account is for business, it is very important that I have access to email while on the go. Using K-9, I am able to effectively manage email to and from our supplier and customers. Couldn't operate the way I want without it!

	<comment>
	   Was a great app but ever since the update, I keep getting certificate errors even though everything is configured correctly. Very annoying that my notification bar is filled with these false positive error messages. Also I noticed my battery drains faster because of always getting the errors. I uninstalled and did a Google search for top email clients and moved over to Blue Mail. Couldn't be happier and no more stupid error messages!

	   I have been using this app for a long time never had an issue with it and the last month I have to import my account settings twice, which is not a big deal but a little bit annoying. It looks like k-9 every time is updating must does everything from he beginning. If you need .more info please do not hesitate to contact me. Thank you.

	<comment>
	   Just received Ver 5.000 and I nolonger can access my email accounts. "Certificate Error". Lets get this fixed. It never asks to get a certificate, press next and it says "Connecting to server" and then it ends. The good news is I can send & receive emails, but when it polls is when I get the Certificate Error notification. I have tried your suggestion, but it doesn't work. Your app now on my phone, constantly posts "Certificate Missing" . And with that, your app eats my battery up. So I have uninstalled your app. I need my emails and whether I post here or on your link on google that I can't find where to post a problem, My post will remain here. I have tried reinstalling, and it failed again. I really think your product applicaton is really great, but since the last update, its been a disaster. So I have moved to a different email client. You can post here if and when you fixed the problem.

	<title>Battery drain unacceptable</title>
	<comment>
	   This was a stellar app I've used for years. Latest update chews through a full charge in about 6 hours. By far the biggest battery user on my N5. Had to uninstall to keep my battery running long enough to last an international flight.

	   was using on my nexus 5. it was a struggle and a half to get my icloud account working, but i was finally able to do so. when i switched to the moto x, copied all of the settings exactly from the nexus, and yet the icloud account cannot be configured to send mail. tried everything. tired of fighting with it. chose the stock android mail app and lo and behold, the account set up automatically and correctly when i input the account information. sadly deleting K9 from my phone since it's useless to me if i cannot send mail from it.

	<title>Disappearing emails</title>
	<comment>
	   Since the latest update, some emails disappear right after they come in. I get a notification, the subject briefly shows at the top of my phone, then the email is gone. It doesn't appear in ANY of the account folders. Not even the trash. This is a big problem. And, no, I don't want to spend hours navigating your user UN-friendly site just to try to report this. I tried that. It's a huge waste of time. Samsung galaxy s4

	<title>Great tool! Though Sent Items folder cannot be synced easily.</title>
	<comment>
	   I am trying using K-9 mainly for offline search and it seems to work just fine. However my sent email at Office 365 is in folder called Sent Items (likely this is always the case with Outlook and cannot be changed) and, despite I specifically configured K-9 to sync Sent Items, it still insists on syncing Sent (and finds nothing). I hope this issue can be patched. Thanks a lot for the great tool! Update: Go to 'Account settings > Fetching mail > Incoming server' and press the "Next" button. This will refresh setting and cause K-9 to sync Sent Items.

	<comment>
	   As of 10/2/2014 this app is unusable. All I get are cert errors. No way to get it to stop. My hosting providers cert does not match my domain name, but most email apps allow you to ignore this. Not sure if this is related to the error I'm getting but it went from working to DoA after installing the new version. Had to uninstall it and look for an alternative.

	   Do not use automatic update for this app. The latest version 5.0 is incompatible with most email providers and K9s response is to get you provider to upgrade their system. NOT customer friendly!

	   I have used k9 for years, but unfortunately this latest update has made it too annoying to use. It still works well and has more functionality than any other email app I can find (that is why it is 3 stars and not 1), but the constant certificate errors for my 3 imap accounts are driving me crazy. I hope they are able to fix this issue so I can setup my email in K9 again (but for now Blue Mail will work).

	   AVL Pro detected adware in Maildroid, so I came looking for an equally capable yet clean mail client. It is THE most capable, user-friendly mail app I had ever used over my career of 32 years in ICT. One little snag: no LED for new mail arrivals, despite being set up. OpenPGP excellent.

	   I've used this app for months to replace the crappy stock mail app on my Galaxy S5 without an issue. After speaking with clients later in the day today, I realized none of the emails sent this morning were sent. They were all hanging out in my outbox folder! After multiple attempts at resolving the problem, I gave up and defaulted to using my Gmail to send my messages. Thanks for the update that made me blow my productive work day!

	<title>Good email app; battery drain</title>
	<comment>
	   As an e-mail app for Android, I love K-9. It's flexibility means you can do anything you want (I never hit limits), and the UI is intuitive and easy to work with. However: I recently noticed my phone was draining its battery too fast. I did some tests, fully charging the phone, rebooting it, leaving K-9 open in the background to pick up my emails, but reading them with another app I wanted to try out. 10 hours later, K-9 had run up one hour of "keep awake" time (even though I hadn't opened the app once - it was all background) and the other app (that I'd used throughout the day) just 9 minutes. So I disabled K-9, but the "keep awake" time kept increasing one minute in ten, so some background process was obviously thrashing the CPU. The next day, phone rebooted, K-9 disabled - the phone is cooler to touch and its charge lasted the full day. I don't know which update introduced the problem, but at some point K-9 has started using too much battery, where other apps (used in the same way) have not. I like the app enough to return to it - after some more upgrades, especially if they mention battery issues - I'll probably give it another try.

I guess now I can just say that a more detailed explanation on this would of helped.

	   I have been using K9 for my Yahoo email account for about 4 years. I have a mail server at home which downloads and deletes my Yahoo emails (which is why I don't use Yahoo's app). I have had the same exact settings on K9 since the beginning. Never had an issue. Now the latest K9 update has caused issues. I keep getting certificate error nag messages but the app still works.

	   I used to use the built in Android mail program, but had a lot of various issues. Got fed up and downloaded this. Loved this program. Updates have only made it better. -update 1/27/14: reply to an email, save it as a draft, come back to it later, you'll notice part of the first line of the original email and part of the first line of the reply have swapped. Why?

	<comment>
	   All of a sudden I could no longer send email, only receive. I went to the server settings for outgoing mail, and clicked next and immediately got an error. I didn't notice at first, but after the update, www was added in front of my outgoing server. removed the www and it worked fine as it should. Thought I'd post this in the review section in case others come here with the same issue

	<comment>
	   Ever since the update I get daily errors about an invalid certificate. But if I go to the account screen and connect, all is fine. The really odd thing, is that K-9 has NO option to accept any certificate. All implementations of OpenSSL allow you to accept any cert and encrypt the channel - K-9 should have this, and just ignore any potential errors. I am not worried about a MitM attack, so just quit nagging me - or if there is a real error, tell me what it is.

	   After install I went and re verified incoming and outgoing server settings, as suggested by Dev's replies to others. Send/receive all perfect. But when attaching, still can't select multiple files at once. Perhaps this depends on which app you use to select files, Drive, File manager, etc?

	   Has been a great email client, but recently a lot of persistent quirks - doesn't show my most recent mail, although they show up in notifications. Now keeps telling me my server settings are wrong (no changes except the upgrade), and the application keeps stopping. Goign to have to change over to some other IMAP email app.

	   At first glance one might be scared by the numerous options but this is probably a price one must pay for this very customizable mail app. Non the less it has become my standard mail app. I just wish I could get it to not display mails grouped in a conversation but show them individually but I guess there's also an option for that which I just haven't found yet.

	<comment>
	   I love this app and it's great for what I use it for -- multiple secure IMAP connections, including one to a fussy MSExchange service. But the latest version here stores HUGE numbers of "Exception: message count -1 for folder XXX" and I/O errors and PUSH errors in the K9 Errors folders -- and these aren't errors. They're what happen when you walk around with a mobile device and change wifi speeds, access points, and cell towers. And those exceptions now take up space in your message storage for the app. Also they've discontinued the option for older security methods -- and that's great for security, except when you have to turn security OFF because you can't personally upgrade the server you have to use. I may have to downgrade to maintain usability for my needs, but in all I'm very happy with this app and the hard work from the development team to keep this a five-star product.

	<comment>
	   Keep getting certificate errors with latest update (v5.000). Having to manually check settings to read mail on Yahoo mail servers is a pain. Never had a problem before this update. On Moto X with KitKat.

	<title>Almost perfect but greedy!</title>
	<comment>
	   I've always used K9 but with several accounts it is annoying that the polling intervals cannot be set individually. It appears that they can but they always revert to the interval that is shortest. This results in an unnecessary use of bandwidth - not significant on Wi-Fi but important on mobile data. It seems like it should be a simple fix to prevent the greedy use of data unnecessarily.

	   I've been using K-9 Mail for a couple years now and really like it. It handles my roaming (offline) well, saving replies & drafts for later, integrates w/multiple IMAP ACCTS, etc. It just works! And is very configurable (business/fun/private accts, etc).

	   I really like this app. It has all the necessary functions and a nice look and feel but the Exchange support uses WebDav, so no push support for Hotmail. I found a new, competing app that works, so I'm switching until dude decides to rise to the challenge.

	   The only flaw I see is that the app does not have an icon with an unread email counter. The widget is fine but I can't put it in my quick app section at the bottom of the screen for my Samsung Galaxy. Wish they would create an icon too as well as the widget with the counter.

	   I really look at the user experience and K-9 just doesn't appeal to me aesthetically. I prefer the gmail app over this since I only have gmail accounts. It's otherwise a great app.

	<comment>
	   This is a good e mail client for most of the EMail purpose. However, limited signature customisation and no contact sync with server makes it less useful exchange client for me. Would love to give five star when these two updates are available in future.

	<title>Seems good, but idiotic setup</title>
	<comment>
	   On the plus side, it was very easy to add email accounts. On the minus side, the setup was badly designed. Conflict ? Maybe, but for some reason the setup procedure picks up EVERY folder AND file on your host - in my case creating 4 times as many "email" accounts that actually existed. I suspect maybe a bug ? So, for example, if you have a FILE on your server called myFile.php K9 picks this up as another email folder ! Seriously bad bit of design there. You have to manually select each error and mark it as "2nd class" to hide it (no multi-select option) - there is no apparent way to tell K9 to actually remove it. Another issue - minor, but irritating - is if you click on an email with the intention of opening it, instead of opening it you instead get a list of emails from the same person. OK, so you can then click on the email AGAIN in this new list to actually ropen it but what an un-necessary step. Not a disaster, just annoying. BUt those two bizarre issues aside seems a good package..

	<title>Best Android mail program...</title>
	<comment>
	   What I like most: after reading new mails the programs does not close when you push the back button, but always goes one step up in the program, so possible other unread mails become visible as well! Very practical! And of course: it functions all very smoothly with a friendly interface and tons of customizations!

	   Great app but the push functionality isn't working. I have to manually refresh the inbox for messages. I have not changed any settings from the default install. Does it push mail from Hotmail? I have a Samsung Galaxy S3 LTE. Would be 5 star otherwise.

	   Functionality of the app is excellent, however a subpar user interface, difficulty in finding the right settings, and inconsistent/confusing terminology used to describe the same functions in different places are a bit problem for me.

	<comment>
	   I have the Samsung Note 2. I have been using it for 2 years and very happy with it. But lately it keeps going out and fetching mail that it has already fetched and email that it had deleted. It also isn't deleting mail off server anymore like it used to. This is becoming a real nuisance and is causing me to rethink keeping k-9 any longer.

	<comment>
	   Waste of time. Downlaoded this app, then spent an hour trying to save attachments to sdcard. Downloaded OI File Browser; selected path where i want to store atrachment (sdcard). K-9 shows that it stored it where you wanted, but browsing for the file, it keeps storing it on the phone and not the sdcard. So great, I try to open the pdf file that it saved and it errors out saying the file is not valid. So.... free or not; if it doesn't work it's still crap. UNINSTALLED

	   I especially like this app for the select all feature in the trash folder and empty trash all at once. This is something that android mail apps don't allow.

	   Updated 8/29/14: App has not synced my emails for the past 24 hrs. Problems with my emails synced from GoDaddy.聽 The alerts appear but emails read no text and at other times, the emails appear only 1 second after the alerts arrives.. then immediately disappears from the in box until a few days later.

	<comment>
	   I was looking for an email app for my moto x to replace the stock app which would not delete multi-emails. I run Outlook on my desktop PC. I installed K9 on my moto x yesterday and it was easy to set up. Today I noticed that the emails on my PC did not match the emails on my moto x... some were missing from both; in other words if I have K9 running, the incoming emails go to K9 but are not duplicated on my PC email. Not good. I need ALL incoming emails on BOTH my phone AND PC. I looked though all of the settings - no help. I went online and tried for two hours to get help from K9... I am technically savvy, but getting help from K9 is impossible. So unfortunately I uninstalled K9 and reinstalled the stock app that I don't like, but it works as it should. Thus the one star. If I could have accessed some help without wasting my entire morning I would keep that app and give a higher rating. K9, if you're reading this please contact me and help me!

	   Does the job. K9 is miles ahead of the Samsung/android mail client. I have 7 email accounts I monitor using this app & I have no problem keeping everything separate & locatable using colour tags & different notification tones. 1 thing it's missing is the ability to NOT stop headphone audio every time an email is received. (But this maybe a Samsung issue)

	<comment>
	   This was once the only email app I would ever use. But it has really gone downhill since. There are so many bugs it isn't even funny! Deleting emails and they just come back. Displays duplicates, even though the server is correct. Marking emails as read and they just come back as unread a few minutes later. Not to mention, this app doesn't even support S/MIME certificates for signing and encrypting emails. Oh, but they give you the option to use another app for this, but that app doesn't even support one of the most popular certificate types (S/MIME). If these devs get their acts together and bring this app back up to par, then I would be happy to try it again and rerate for more stars. But as it stands today, this app is not even worth 1 star.

	   Great e-mail client, very convinient and clean UI. The only drawback for me is the lack of opportunity to show messages from one sender in a separate folder. The app manages to do so only if the subject of conversation is preserved, but I often have messeges from the same sender with different subjects

	   Great email app for traveling. Fetches my pop mail, leaves what I keep on the server and removes what I delete. Much better than the built in app.

	<title>Excellent email app</title>
	<comment>
	   I love this app. It gives me exactly what I want, a simple list of emails I receive. But it is pretty customizable and you can have it do more like show pictures of people who emailed you and color coding ect. I have 2 email addresses going into one inbox. And best of all 100% FREE with NO ADS !!! It does have a default signature with K9 in it but you can turn it off.

	   Even though I enter my password correctly it doesn't accept it, says that mail or password is wrong. I checked opening the same account through a browser but didn't find any problem there!

	<title>Missing support for IMAP keywords ("todo tags")</title>
	<comment>
	   A great alternative! Made the switch because the stock e-mail client couldn't sync anything except inbox due to folder structure. But I'm hugely missing support for IMAP keywords! In order to tag from the phone and get the tags synchronised to Thunderbird and (Roundcube) webmail.

	   I switched to this because I moved all my mail back to IMAP and the default mail app was not saving my sent emails. Now I have all my received and sent synced up. If I send it from Thunderbird i see it sent on the phone and vice versa. Lots more options than the default app too.

	<comment>
	   Unlike Cloud Mail and Blue Mail, your mail and mail account security are not retained on a vulnerable pass-through server possibly in a questionable country. Features may not be as extensive as other apps now, but its open-source contributor base is very active.

	<comment>
	   K9 team, you have an awesome app. I would ask that you consider one enhancement. When someone has to make back-to-back calls, the K9 app tries to sync every time data is available, not by the time interval requested by the user, delaying the ability to make calls. It causes me to turn off sync, which defeats the purpose of time intervals anyway. Thanks for a great app.

	   It's basically impossible to select a text. If I move the cursor of my selection down, the mail scrolls down, if I move it up, the mail scrolls up ! First time that I witness such a bugged selection tool on Android. And I saw some nasty ones. I keep it for a few weeks hoping for a fix. Or I'll move on to sthg else. Samsung S3 Mini. Android 4.1.2.

	  email is always a hassle to configure, and I found it confusing trying to setup which folders to display, but ultimately this is my preferred app. its fast, very customisable, can bypass android sync option, doesn't drain battery, has a backup option which does not save your email password.

	   I have installed the app and amazingly for first one week everything works fine with the ms exchange server. Alas suddenly the inbox stops showing up the messages since the folder displays with 'ioexception error with cod'. I thought probably the whole app become incompatible with the ews, but found sent items is working fine. All the emails that are sent to the corp addr and personal one are correctly delivered. Any clue suggestion from k9 development group ?

	<title>Disappearing Email</title>
	<comment>
	   I've been using this program for years. Recently my phone gives me a notification that I have new email. I go to my inbox and see the new email and then it disappears. I'm set up using Imap and the email client is GoDaddy. Godaddy blames the phone or K9. The on board email program don't do this. I log into Web mail for Godaddy and the disappearing email is still in my inbox. There is a syncing problem. Searching the Internet I find this is a problem.

	<comment>
	   I'm extremely satisfied with this. I am in an industry that requires a responsive functional email client. This actually receives, and sends gmail messages faster than the android gmail app by google! And even PGP and viewing message headers?? This is great! The only complaint I have is that I'm unable to search messages and that are on an IMAP server. The search function hangs. Please fix this. I'm still rating this 5 stars. ***** I fully support open source software on Android.

	   The main bug which entitles you to score 1 star to this server is that it doesn't remember the addressee you previously filled in. Every time you need to send email to an address, every time you need to write the address fully again and again - it doesn't save it never! Very uncomfortable

	<comment>
	   After a morning of searching and infuriating failures of other apps, I came to K9. I tried Google, Outlook, and all the others. I even tried some payware. None of them came anywhere close to matching the functionality and ease-of use/setup as K9. Where Microsoft and Google have failed, a group of independent developers have succeeded. Thank you guys for having brains and the ability to use them. Now if we can just get the icon changed... Honestly it was the silly, superficial reason I didn't come here first.

	    because with this app you have all below options : 1- you can send bcc without need to input original reception (to) 2- you can sort email by read/unread message and have other options 3- you can edit email and delete previous sender. in the other simular apps you haven't all options in app

	   Use to love the product but the sync of folders and search for emails is getting bad. Sometimes making me feel stupid infront of the customer cause I know I sent them an email and I can't find it on the phone even if I force load more emails. Come to my computer at the office and there is the email in the sent folder. Sync is getting bad. But for basic email the product is still good.

	   Used to be great, but... Since the devs stopped listening to users it has become useless if you use ssl self signed certs on SUPPORTED operating systems. Devs say it is insecure. Thats MY problem, not theirs. Now have to find something that WORKS instead of this now useless piece of junk.

	   Push is so unreliable that it's more reliable to turn on polling, and not all folders in my Gmail account are accessible in this client (and for no good reason, I might add. I have "show all folders" enabled). If this works for you, then enjoy using what the best email client available for Android. Chances are though, you will have the experience I am having. I'll try again in a few months and see if the bugs are fixed.

	   It won't sync my mail for me...I have to do it manually. That is fine for those accounts that I don't need to check on a regular basis. Tried searching for help on how to fix that and found nothing. Guess I will be looking for a different email app.

	<comment>
	   It's a pretty decent email application. The only fault I find with is its inability to correctly resize emails to fit the page. A high enough percentage emails received are too large for the screen. The auto fit feature is no longer in the menus.

	   This is a great replacement for the Yahoo Mail app. The most recent update has provided an option to place the signature before the quoted response or after the quoted response. That was my only complaint in earlier versions, thank you so much for fixing it!

	<title>Nice app, lacking many features</title>
	<comment>
	   The UI in this application is quite well done. Unfortunately many features are missing or available in a broken way. In particular PGP/MIME support is missing (inline only support with a plug in), and exchange support is way behind the times (supports 2007 or older). From the looks of the bug trackers, neither will be forthcoming anytime soon, which is sad because it's actually a rather nice program otherwise. For now the email app that's built in to the Note 3 covers these & more.

	<title>Auto-sync fail</title>
	<comment>
	   Mostly pretty satisfied. I can have all my e-mail accounts in one place and check them once in a while, answer them, organise them, save drafts, upload images and so on. However I don't get notifications upon receiving new e-mails nor do the appear in the inbox unless I manually click or motion for a refresh. I initially didn't care as I wanted to avoid using mobile data but I am now getting more data and don't care when I am on WiFi. So I activated background sync when auto-sync is checked ( which it is).

	   This app doesn't update the yahoo email accounts automatically. The app has to be refresh every time to see the new emails. One more thing i noticed which is missing is: it doesn't show is it up to date or not. The application is getting stuck updating yahoo account drafts folder and never finishes until app is force stopped. This is costing battery and network data.

	<comment>
	   Ever since owning my first Android YEARS ago while also employed with Blackberry specializing in their world reknowned 3rd party/hosted mail services (BIS, not BES), K9 was the first 3rd party mobile mail client I chose to replace the hideous stock mail client and test against BIS. Hands down K9 put BIS to shame. To this day there hasn't been another mail client for android that can hold a candle to K9 as far as reliability, ease of use, pleasant/professional UI design and customization options. Get this!

	   I suggest you stay away from the K9 app. After I installed it, my SPAM spiked. I mean went crazy. I don't know if they are selling their email list or are easily hacked, but it's horrible. It's ironic, too. I liked how this app appeared to deal with SPAM. Man, was I in for a surprise.

	   Since the last update even when I read an email, 2 minutes later it says the email is unread. Only gave it one star to attract attention to this issue. This is a 5 star app otherwise and has been perfect in the past. I easily imported all my settings from my previous phone. Good feature

	<comment>
	   This app no longer opens on my samsung galaxy note since the last update. It just has a black screen for a few seconds and then closes back to my home screen. Please fix this or i have to uninstall...Update! Reinstalling fixed the problem, works perfect now.

	<title>Doesn't support PGP/MIME</title>
	<comment>
	   Would be great for receiving GnuPG-encrypted mail, but it supports only inline PGP messages, which are widely discouraged and which most email programs don't do by default. It's too much of a hassle to ask everyone sending you email to change the settings on their end to use inline instead of MIME just so you can read your email on your Android device.

	   SO happy to have the move message bug fixed! (I could read and Mark message but any attempt to move it except for deletion meant the all crashed. NO MORE! And I'm working with a rather large email account via IMAP. I hated losing access to an exchange server and using Touchdown, but this app is a great replacement tool!)

	   It's only gotten better over time, Doesn't need Sync to be on which can drain the battery something rotten. And the Mac like Unified Inbox makes it easier to read your mails, instead of having to pop in and out of multiple Inboxes.

	   I am signed in to five different emails from one app! So long to switching between Gmail, Outlook, and yahoo, since this one supports every format I've thrown at it. Only thing I would love to see in future updates is more visual flare and perhaps a new icon, but those are minor gripes.

	<title>Can't see threaded inbox+sent</title>
	<comment>
	   Wasted over an hour on trying to display only inbox and sent mails in conversations. Guess what - it is not supported! The sent/inbox messages of the same thread are separately displayed, so after sending a mail you are left wondering what you've just written, without an easy way to read all messages in the same thread.

	<title>Great but won't delete hotmail messages from server</title>
	<comment>
	   When deleting a message in K9 for a hotmail account it remains on the server. Settings have been double checked several times and are correct. POP deletion is enabled in my hotmail account. A real shame as otherwise it's a fantastic email client.

	<comment>
	   I've used K-9 for over a year and it's always been awesome. Very customizable, and I love the quiet time setting which allows you to silence it during certain hours of the day. Since the most recent update, however, there have been many problems. The app no longer notifies me when I have new mail on my Gmail account; I have to open up the app and look. Even worse, it's draining my battery like crazy. Please fix or I'll have to uninstall!

	<title>Did not live up to the hype</title>
	<comment>
	   I was looking for an email server to replace the default one on android phone. The default wouldn't allow my emails to stay deleted. When I looked up how to fix it all the advice kept saying to get this server. I had it for 2 days and deleted it. First I couldn't delete a lot of emails at one time. It was either all and I then I had to uncheck the emails I wanted to keep or delete one at a time. I like how the default email categorizes it by date. Also the kept telling me there was a connection error.

	   Once you export your K9 settings to your new device, its impossible to open the .k9s attachment, even to email or copy it. Otherwise fabulous piece of software! Very robust, light an simple to use. Overall well done.

	   If you find the default stock email app too spartan and want more control over which folder to sync more often than the rest as an example, this app is for you. The UI could perhaps use a bit more bling but it's good at what it does.

	   Was horrified today to find that this app has a major power problem. On average it sucks up in excess of 3 times more than the screen does. 63% battery usage taken by an Email program. No wonder I'm always in trouble for battery life. Have to remove this app now

	   Deceptively simple looking, this is a highly configurable and functional email app. Multiple account syncs and individual message loads are quite snappy on my Moto X. It also performs much better than the default Android email app, and with none of the quirks I'd previously experienced using a paid-for competitor.

	<comment>
	   By far the easiest phone mail app to set up that I've ever used. Interface is clean, yet I want to be able to send a draft I've saved but there isn't an option for that. I have people sending me texts telling me they've sent email & wondering why I haven't replied to it - explaining that I haven't gotten it is starting to sound contrived.

	  The new upgrade is great! The user pictures make it easier to find a letter in your inbox and you can still do everything that it use to, even deleting more than one e-mail at a time. You just slide your finger over the letter instead of tapping it.

	   Had a brief spot of trouble adding my mail account - until I noticed that for some reason it populated both incoming and outgoing server names with mail.<account.com> (Not telling you who my provider is lol. Also unhappy that it chose the non SSL account setting by default, however changed these over simply enough and is now happily downloading mail from my account. Don't like the different colours at the start of each message either, but appart from that it works.

	<comment>
	   I upgraded to version 4.803 from version 4.200. Big mistake! The new version is very, very slow when looking at the inbox or reading an email. I tried what the developer recommends for this. (resetting all the mail folders in K9) That made it a little faster. I was forced to reinstall version 4.200 and now K9 is fast once again. I have an HTC Evo 5 which is a fast phone, so it is not the phone.

	   I needed an andoid imap client with the ability to change the email and reply-to headers. I use an anonymous mailbox, and don't want it's address in the headers. K9 does this quite well, albeit that the anonymous mailbox is still there for the X-authenticated-as header. As for the resit of it's functionality, I'll see how I get on with it in the long term.

	<title>One of the best clients</title>
	<comment>
	   One of the best email clients I've tried. I've tried quite a few. This one behaves the closest to the way I like. Almost perfect. It has plenty of features and ways to customize it. EDIT: I had a problem in Sent list displaying all items with the Sender field, but somehow I managed to make it display the Recipient. I have two suggestions. At least in the folders list put the name or email of the active account (whose folders we're looking at). The side color only is not enough. Also a way to rearrange the folders, now they are sorted by name but I'd wish Inbox at the top, then Sent, All Mail etc. A sliding folders list from the left edge like in other email clients would be very neat. Update2: no password protection of passwords and program?! Really.. I'm to uninstall it, too bad, otherwise it's the best email app around. SAD.

	   I set the quiet time, didn't matter, I still got mail in the middle of the night and so on. Changed sync time to once in 2 hours, didn't matter. Turned off notifications, didn't matter, I still got notifications. Maybe I couldn't figure out how to use it, but I definitely didn't like it.

	<title>Best mail client with GunPG support</title>
	<comment>
	   Install this plus APG for full GnuPG encryption, decryption, and signing support. This is one of the first apps I install on any new device. One caveat: if you happen to be a fan of Google Now, using anything other than the official GMail app will neuter Now's ability to integrate with your mail. To me, GnuPG support is more important, so K9 is my mail client of choice.

	   The app does what it's meant to. It has various customisable options which are useful. What I would like it to do is make more use of phone specific features. I'm using a Galaxy S5 so I want it to be able to utilise air controls and air gestures in a similar fashion to the stock email app (although with a longer preview when hovering a finger over an entry). Can the developers implement this?

	   Although when forwarding a message and removing the original senders info at the top of the original message also removes any inline pictures and formatting. Besides that it appears to work well.

	   This app did a great job until about 2 months ago. Now, I can't email anything using my Verizon email address. It also loses read but un-deleted emails when I get new emails. The lost ones are not in the inbox or in the trash folder. I'm deleting this app right now

	   Best feature for me is auto bcc to self. Lots of controls but I agree that boxes for bulk actions would be better than colors taking up space - looks like gmail, which doesn't impress me. Also, font selection is lacking - e.g., italic and bold. But, that said, the auto bcc to self rose in importance after I had to replace my phone and reload multiple email accounts with no ability to recover email sent from phone on personal accounts I didn't remember or bother to bcc myself on.

	   I love the open source nature of this mail app. It's like Mozilla Thunderbird for Android. Everything seems to be in order, except for auto sync. It's not working at all, not for any one of the mail accounts, and even more for Hotmail. I need to manually poll for new mails in my mail accounts. I believe this defeats the very purpose of this app.

	<comment>
	   Great, great improvement over the samsung galaxy supplied email app. 5 Stars if you can configure the POP3 server to delete emails off the server as you download them. I also like that it displays my contact pictures in the message list - I was wishing my old email could do that. I don't really know what the hubbub is about the letters beside the messages - it does not add much value, but does not deserve the vitriol i have read on so many other reviews.

	   For someone who is used to emails on PC this app works in a very strange way, for one thing for some unknown reason it keeps loosing emails from the inbox when checking for new ones I've set it to save all emails but that does,nt work, I'm using a tablet not a phone and have plenty of room, why can't these email apps work the same as normal PC programmes

	   It's a fantastic email app. The only thing that would make it better would be to have a delete option from the pull down menu. I can reply and mark it read, but I can't delete. That's the only thing that's missing.

	<comment>
	   I use several email accounts on different servers. K-9 has been able to handle my needs much better than the stock email client. It has some quirks but it's reliable. The preferences are extensive and complicated. For some reason Verizon's Android 4.3 update to my phone in January made this and other apps suck my battery dry. I have been adjusting and adapting but no perfect solution yet. Feature-wise, the closest app to K9 I have tried is Maildroid, and I prefer K9.

	   All my emails are Gmail but gmail app is too complicated to set up and cannot do batch opration. K9 works perfectly for me. Easy setup. It has Multi Select Checkbox (in Setting). Gmail no longer has this option. I llike K9.

	<title>Great email client</title>
	<comment>
	   Used it for years on various phones. Great app. Slight suggestion, allow me to rearrange the icons at the bottom when in a message view. I want the optional extras (delete, archive, move, copy etc) but don't want them to replace reply and compose, which currently get pushed into the 'more' menu if I enable them. I want the optional extras under the more menu and the reply and compose always on screen.

	<comment>
	   Everything is working great with this application. I have 2 Gmail accounts and an iCloud account all attached and they work awesome. Just can't get the attachments to save to the SD. Keeps giving me an error when I try to do it. I want to free up some space on my S5. If they fix this, then they will have a top notch application here.

	<comment>
	   Needs a manual. For AOL - I could never figure out where all my old read mail disappeared to. Sometimes they would show up? I figured out if clicking on left side of folder to open, all mail will show. Right side (where the count is) shows unread mail. It took me probably 6 months to realize this was the reason. To multi select just swipe across one unopened email (read or unread), then the rest can be tapped to mark read or delete. .ect. Lots of other features, just takes tinkering.

	<comment>
	   Installed this to get around the lack of security support on the default Android mail client. Installed perfectly on a Nexus 7 and HTC Desire phone, setup easily and worked perfectly. Would not use the default clients again. To the user who criticises this for not having the 'check boxes' - turn them back on through the Multi Select Checkboxes in the Settings>Global Settings>Display Options

	<comment>
	   I downloaded this for my work email and while I'm sure it's a fine email app, I couldn't test it because Exchange 2010 doesn't have WebDAV which is required to run this app. They probably should tell you this in the description.

	   Needed something to replace Gmail app, to switch between threaded and non-threaded view. This did the trick, & then some! To UI complaints, everything is in settings & customizable. Little glitchy - archiving doesn't always reflect right away - have to back out & in to see changes. Clicking Inbox sometimes gives whole Inbox, sometimes Priority label, depending where I'm clicking. Needs to show & apply Gmail's multi-labels on msgs, links to Gmail tabs (Priority, Promotionks, Social, etc.), & yellow stars.

	   the screen display (folders, not individual messages) shows multiple message headers as if they were overlaid on each other, displaced by a few pixels, on my Droid DNA - while the native mail client does not display the problem. since there is really no developer to complain to, my only real option is to uninstall it and go elsewhere. sigh.

	   April 8, 2014 K-9 lost all my emails and will not "load 1000 more messages" when I tell it to even though the server has all the email still there. My battery also showed K-9 using more than my screen - crazy. I've rebooted, cleared the cache, and it still won't load emails before April 8. Today is April 15 & I have 12 emails. A week ago I had a whole lot more. What happened?

	<comment>
	   I just switched from a flip phone and iPod touch to the Moto. When I setup my exchange account, the app told me that my server REQUIRES me to allow it full access and control over MY phone. Bye bye. K-9 was setup in about a minute and a half, didn't need to allow access to any of MY personal information, and the interface looks to be well thought out and user friendly. I especially like the "split screen in landscape view". Granted, I haven't looked around that much, but this app works perfectly for me, so I'm done looking, on to better things. I don't even care that Gmail isn't supported. Great job, guys! Update 4/15/14: Gmail is supported but I ran into some problems when I decided to change settings on my Exchange account. Basically, every change I made caused some function to fail. Display, sync, notification problems got worse and worse until finally the app was beginning to make me feel stupid, so I uninstalled and moved on to a paid app. Regular IMAP/POP email is OK, but needs more work in order to use Exchange accounts.

	   This is by far the greatest e-mail app for android. Easy to use, pushes e-mail immediately and has an option to turn off conversation view.

	   I. Hate. Gmail with a passion! That's why I came looking for something else to help me with the mess Google calls email. When you have more SPAM than mail you need a new account. If I could I would but everybody I know has known what my acct is for years! Only problem is when effin Google changed things. Now K9 has done mail the same way! WHY?!?! If it aint broke, dont fix it! You make more problems by doing such. The only way I can delete a msg is by opening each one and deleting. That's not happening!

	<comment>
	   Tried as an alternative to Aquamail but where the hell is the Reply button?! I always use my phone in portrait mode so I don't want one that appears when I go into landscape, nor do I want to have to access it via a menu screen. This has got to be the most unintuitive mail app I've ever used, so glad I didn't pay for premium! It looks a bit better than Aquamail but that's it!

	<title>Lots of settings</title>
	<comment>
	   Pretty comparable to the stock email (not Gmail) app, with one important addition: you can back up & restore and/or export & import your settings, so no need to redo all your account settings every time you change ROMs. It does a few things better than the stock app, and a few less well. It appears that most of the people making negative reviews have just failed to wade through the very extensive settings menus. Most of the features people are asking for, such as threaded conversations and checkboxes for multiple selections, can be enabled there. Messages can be moved to folders by long pressing them, at least on IMAP. I don't use POP3, so not sure if it is possible with those accounts. True, it does not allow changing fonts, but neither does the stock email app. Whether it overrides font settings that you make within the settings for your email account, I don't know. I would hope not, but I have not tested it.

	  Pretty good but for one lacking - the inability to remove emails from the inbox and sort them into archive folders on-device. Okay, so IMAP does that on server but when your Telstra provider refuses to support IMAP what do you do.

	   Looks really nice with some good features, but no way to delete emails unless you hold down on the email till a popup appears with the option to delete. If it had a way to check off each email to be selected for deletion, I would give it 5 stars. As it is now, its just not worth using

	<comment>
	   Maybe its because I am a graphic designer but this design literally gets worse the more you use this app. I mean it needs a sleeker icon. I ignore bad icons but geeez. This is hideous. Lots of apps have different icons to pick for each apk. It needs something simple and contemperary The gray buttons are not cohesive with the white selection interface and the text is offset. It bugs me a little.

	<comment>
	   Every time you try to read messages, there's a hair trigger "pull to refresh" function that sends it into a loop of expensive data polling - no way to shut it off. Nearly useless as is and this is apparently a deliberate addition to what could've been a very nice program.

	<comment>
	   Great app for consolidating all my inboxes, I've used a few and this is he best I have found. However when I get notified of a new mail message in the pull-down menu, there are 2 options: 'Reply' or 'Mark As Read'. If these buttons were made smaller there would be room for a 'Delete' button which considering sll the smap going around these days would be more useful. 5 stars if this is fixed! Agreed- new update isn't great and no need for pictures of the sendees.

	<comment>
	   Over the last month it's crashed more and more. This week, it crashes when I try to move an email to another folder. Also, after I send an email and go to the next message the new message doesn't show. Just the header does. This looks like an old issue that's resurfaced. Really making it unusable. I love the app. Just wondering if deleting and reinstalling will fix it. All the other apps I've tried this week are lacking the awesomeness of this one.

	   Sony tablet S, yea it's old. :) But this app has been very stable. The only issue I have had was due to my ISP playing silly games with the email system. Had to rebuild the account but that was easy.

	<comment>
	   I've been using this app consistently for some time now, and now that work on supporting PGP/MIME is underway with APG, all that will be left is integration with APG's PGP/MIME support. Truly an awesome app combination. I am leaving the rating at 4 stars because of the PGP/MIME issue. Once it is resolved, I feel it will become a 5-star app.

	<comment>
	   I used to love this app but frankly now, it sucks. It constantly freezes, it's slow to get things done, even simple things like marking all as read takes ages to perform and sometimes freezes the whole app. This app has become cumbersome and an annoyance and it's with regret that I have to look for something else.

	   Can't swipe mail to trash or anywhere even with gestures enabled. Also has some sync issues, mail gets stuck at times and good luck if you are trying to refile or archive it. Overall good app tho i have it linked to four email accounts and it hits em all smooth.

	   This app's background sync will burn through your data plan in days if you have many messages on your server. It's such a known issue that a widget has been written to try to stop it.

	   Have been using K9 for years but I hate the new update. Now it works just like Google mobile Mail which I don't use. Why would I need all these colored boxes with the first initial of the sender? How the heck is that helpful? It's very confusing and unnecessary. Looking for another client asap.

	   Been using the app for ages on previous android device and it's great. Have just switched to a Note 3 and wish this had the split screen capability of the native app. Not really a bug so haven't submitted it to the tracker, really more of a feature request :) Thanks for the great app guys!

	   The stock Android app was very bad for regular use. K9 is so good, I'm surprised it is free. Besides, it does not have any signature restrictions like other apps. The K-9 icon could do with a makeover though :)

	   If I had one complaint... it would be to change the position of the delete/trash button. I have the Note 3 and it is very easy to hit the the trash button while exiting out of the app using the home button on the Note 3. It would be nice to have the trash can at the top of the page.

	<title>Auto update put me up to Beta version that has bugs...</title>
	<comment>
	   First, let me say that K9 is a good email program. Nice features and works well. However, I started having issues with the notifications. I would send a message with an attachment and it would keep showing "Sending message" icon, even though the message was sent. I submitted a Bug Report and they told me to revert to the previous release, as the one I had was a Beta release (for development). My frustration is, why did it update to a Beta release? I am not a tester, nor did I specifically look for a Beta release. I have it set to update automatically. Shouldn't Beta releases be kept from these auto-updates?

	<comment>
	    This is the only app that I am aware of that is fully compatible with sending/receiving emails that have been secured with a digital certificate. The issue is that it does not sync your calendar or tasks which means you'll have to install a separate program for that.

	   After about a month of perfect operation k9 started crashing every time it tried to sync with the mail server. It appears to be a known issue but I couldn't see a resolution available. This stops it scoring 5 stars

	   This crashes every 20 seconds, locking my phone. The polling is haphazard at best and I frequently get mail posting to the wrong folder. Filters seem to be non existent. Other than that it's not too bad

	<title>Lacks Inter-IMAP movement of emails</title>
	<comment>
	   Great app, but I had to uninstall it. I have three IMAP accounts and I got stuck in K-9 when I needed to move an incoming email to some folder in another IMAP account. The inbuilt email app on my Samsung Galaxy S4 offers that feature. Plus, this is becoming a standard feature in most of the desktop email clients. I wish K-9 had that functionality too in which case, I would have given it 6 out of 5.

	   3/6/2014. well, if I was originally unhappy with the new ui at (4.4), I bit the bullet and went with it anyway. Not sure of my version, but my k9 auto updates, and for about 2 months, now dog slow (apology to dog lovers) with no setting changes on my part. Now looking for alternatives. Great, to good, to below avg, to poor over 5 years.

	<title>Word Wrap Broken by Kitkat?</title>
	<comment>
	   Just like the stock email client, you are unable to pinch to zoom and then double tap to display a single column of readable text. How on earth do the builders of these email clients expect you to read an email when you have to scan horizontally to read each line? I want Jellybean back! Moto X. ~UPDATE~ There is a workaround: go to settings, global,font size and change messages to large. This requires a double tap on each message but makes them readable in a single column of text.Back to 5 stars!

	   Very nice email client, love how clicking on a thread opens it and shows all the messages in it like a sub-folder. However, it sometimes fails to sync and gets stuck on some process that uses up all the CPU on the phone. This obviously drains the battery and heats the phone to uncomfortable temperatures. I will try it again in a few releases to see if that works. I have a Galaxy Note II

	<comment>
	   The most brilliant and powerful Android email client ever made has just been rendered near useless by the Kitkat update. The only way to be able to read emails without endless back and forth scrolling is in landscape mode, and even that doesn't work for some formats. Can this be repaired? How on earth are you expected to scroll back and forth constantly to read emails????? Disastrous. This was a five star app hands down prior to the update. Developers PLEASE get this handled!

	   Works very well. Only suggestion would be to allow user to set a maximum number of emails that are saved in the trash folder. Its waay to easy to accumulate 2000 emails in your trash folder and when you select all and try to delete 2000 emails at once my phone doesn't like it.

	<title>Push isn't pushing</title>
	<comment>
	   Sometimes my emails come in on my phone in a couple of minutes, sometimes 45 min later, they still aren't on my phone, despite the push function being set up. So annoying to do a manual sync for emails to appear.

	   This used to be my favourite mail app. The recent colour explosion has made it visually unappealing for me, and worse yet, there is no way to opt out of the rainbow. I have also started having issue with this app getting hung up when checking my gmail accounts, having negative impact on my battery's life. Disappointing.

	<title>Still my choice for email interface</title>
	<comment>
	   Unfortunately in the latest version it seems that the downloading of email automatically download the entire email including attachments of any size despite setting the limit to 32kb. My data plan usage ended up with huge increase which I had to pay.

	   This is IMHO the best free mail client for android, especially if you manage a lot of accounts and I've tried tens of others. It's lacking some widgets but still - 5 stars from me!

	   it is not acceptable an email client to store in non-volatile fashion the account passkeys. It should ask user for mail's server account password before connecting with server instead. Caching in RAM is less harmfull as non-volatile.

	<comment>
	   Dear Developers, Your App is an awesome mail system in all Android mail app, but I as a business user require few more improvements. 1. Rich Text editor which allows. Bold text, colored text, underline, stylish. 2. Enable column mode. 3. Box editor. 4. Copy paste image/or text as like html view. 5. In short make it closer to MS office. 2nd. Replied mails should be shown on same loop conversation list. But here we needs to go to sent items to see our reply. Guys make it more closer to PC Ms office

	   This is the only IMAP mail client for Android I've found that properly tags replied to & forwarded emails, so that you can see the actions in the Inbox list. Unfortunately, neither of my devices would download new emails after the last update until I cleared all data & set up my accounts again. Also, I'm not a big fan of the new Inbox view with the big first letter of the senders name. I'll have to see if I can find a setting to change it back to the way it was...

	<comment>
	   I have found this to be more configurable than any of the others I have tried (including MailDroid). However, I use a Bluetooth keyboard, and because K-9 relies on the soft keyboard to display spell corrections, I am unable to see spell-check corrections o y real keyboard. (Same problem with MailDroid).

	   A bit of a learning curve because of SO many settings....which is also a plus in customization! So far I am very impressed. Yahoo app definitely got the boot from me. Oh and so far my live/outlook acct is working well too :-) update 2/17/14 sometimes it doesn't show everything in the folders....sync problem I suppose? Still better than the yahoo app.

	   This is the best of all the email apps I have tried. It doesn't seem to have a limit to how many accounts you can use and set up all of them very easily. My only complaint if any, and I acknowledge it's a small stupid one, is the icon. It doesn't reflect what a great business tool this is.

	   K9 mail is easy to use, simple, and has some customization features. It has a fresh, clean look without appearing cheap. The widgets that come with it are nice, too. I just wish I could make folders, so I could sort messages. Other than that, it's great!

	   Also, it changes to gmail style contact icon isn't that good nor practical. For me, I can't recognize where it's from at a glance by only a first single letter shown, even a big RANDOM colored box is no help. Besides, 'star' colors in yellow instead of blue would be great

	<title>NYC Citizen Says Only Email Platform I Will Use</title>
	<comment>
	   As a New Yorker, K9 is the only email provider for my Android. Why? 1. Easy to use. 2. Emails get deleted off of the server even when I am underground in the subway. This is huge as sometimes the only time I have for email housecleaning is during my commute. Other email providers do not offer this. Not the phone's factory mail platform, not Olive Mail, not Web.de......nobody. Pls note that I did IMAP set-up. 3. If u have gmail, just use the gmail platform m it is great. All non gmail users should use K9.

	<comment>
	   I've looked for 15 minutes to send you an email rather than leave poor rating. I have looked for an answer in the FAQs, both with no luck. Gmail does not let me automatically send a cc to anther personal email address automatically, can K9? This would be ideal for syncing sent messages with a desk top. Perfect product name, Master, affirmative?

	<title>Much better battery life than using two mail apps!</title>
	<comment>
	   Switched to K-9 after thorough internet research to consolidate a corporate Exchange and Gmail account onto one app. I had been using the stock app on Droid Mini for Exchange and the Gmail app for my personal Gmail. I like the K-9 interface since it's an easy transition from the similar Gmail app. I am impressed with huge improvement in battery use on my phone since switching over. I have the Exchange set to push (as it was before on stock) and Gmail polling at 15 min intervals and it's been much better than when I used two separate mail apps. I don't think you have the option to set polling frequency on the Gmail app.

	   I started using K9 a long time ago, and then I stopped and moved to the built-in Gmail and Android email apps. But now I'm back to K9 and it is so much better and has a lot of new functions compared to its early stages. Great work by the developers.

Would be nice to make it sync right off the bat without any messages showing that it's not synced. Cannot import contacts from outlook?

	<title>Good app, but always leaves connections open making it unusable</title>
	<comment>
	   While I liked K-9 for all the features that it has and it's new interface, ultimately my IT department made me and a coworker stop using it because my account always had a ton of IMAP connections left open and it would connect with new ones. Similar things happen with other emails like gmail. If I open up logcat, there's always a ton of K-9 messages there about too many simultaneous connections and other random exceptions and null errors. There are several open bug reports about these issues, so maybe in time this will get fixed.

	   I just switched from iOS to Android and this app made that switch easier. Set up is super easy. Syncs with iCloud email FLAWLESSLY! Push works great. If I delete an email from the app on my phone it deletes off my native email program on my MacBook Air just like it did when I had an iPhone. I tried the stock Android app, evomail and cloudmagic but K9 is THE best. Thank you so much devs. Also, color led notifications for each mailbox and a combined mailbox view are super awesome features.

	   I don't like the new version. I can't just click on a message to erase it. I know have to open the whole message to delete.

	   I have been using K9 for about 2 years and really liked it. After the last update, I am going to uninstall. The colors are obnoxious and I can no longer mark emails for deletion from the list.

	   I have been using K9 for nearly three years now, and am very happy. If you sit down and take the time to configure K9 properly, you will find it provides you with amazing granularity of control. AND if configured properly, you will reduce the drain on your battery, and your bandwidth.

	<comment>
	   It has all the features that are lacking from the default apps. Plus I love having my own k-9 unit on my phone. What would make this app amazing is if there were notification sounds from doctor who like "mistress you have a message" in the old k-9 voice or the tardis sound when it moves.!!!!

	   Back to 5 Stars again. Thanks for fixing the problems. Managed to fix my Force Close issues by backing up settings in the old version, then clearing all data and uninstalling. Re-booted phone to be sure. I then installed the latest version and imported my account and global settings from the backup. Working fine so far. The new layout is very easy on the eyes and intuitive to use.

	<comment>
	   My only complaint is that the options available in the landsacape mode do NOT include "reply." I use slide out keyboard so to reply I need to turn the phone upright, press reply then turn back to wide view to compose response. Totally annoying that wider view offers less options. Please fix in next update. Most recent update offers giant check boxes but did not fix ability to read and reply in landscape!

	   I try to fit as many emails on the screen as possible, which the previous version allowed.. Now, unless I turn off the stars visibility I can only now fit a few emails on my note 3... Why are the stars so big?? They only need to be small, please can you reduce them considerably. Cheers

	<title>Update sucks - Appearance and Categories</title>
	<comment>
	   I have used this app for years and updated it last night. The Gmail categories (which were not selected on my gmail) were added to K9, which sucks! So, lucky for me, I use Titanium Backup and just restored the previous apk and data. I'm sure K9 will put out another update soon with the fixes for the things we don't like. Other than that, love the app. :o) For now, 3 stars.

	<comment>
	   I use the select feature a lot, because I have 4 accounts set up on K-9 and get spam. Now I have to click AND HOLD on each email I want to select. You gave up the quick click for an ICON to make it look pretty? btw, it does not work, the icon does not have anything to do with the email!!!!! It is a senseless meaningless ugly extra glob on my screen! It appears to be the first letter on the senders name. How does that help anyone? Also, whats up with the triangle in the lower rh corner? What does that do? GIMME BACK MY QUICK CLICK FEATURE. I thought that was one of the most thoughful features that differentiates you from the pack!

	   Can't for the life of me figure out how to add a folder. Thought it might be syncing with server, so I added it there, nope. Changed the 1st class/2nd class folder settings around (not exactly sure what that's for), nope. I give up. Should be a simple thing right? Nice looking app, like the search and sort functions, like the dark theme.

	<title>Why can't I move files out of the trash that I accidentally deleted??</title>
	<comment>
	   So using a POP account and I accidentally deleted an email. I can see that the email is in the K9 trash folder but for the life of me I cannot find a way to move it back to the inbox. Even if I forward the email to myself out of the trash can I get a message saying cannot download from server. Any help here?!

	  I have used this app with every phone I've had since 2010, and I love everything about it. My only complaint about the most recent version is that you took away the check boxes. I used to be able to check multiple emails to delete them in one action. Now I have to delete each one individually. Is there a way to turn this functionality back on and I missed it? Thanks.

	   This latest version is a disaster! It now spends ages trying to fetch mail and exits with a socket timeout error. This is particularly bad on all 3 Gmail accounts I have. How can I download the previous version which worked perfectly. Android 4.2.1 on ZTE V967S

	   This is the best email app around, and the fact that it is free makes it even more amazing. After the latest re - styling it is also beautiful, fast and helps you keep your inboxes organised and finding messages easily. I used different email apps, and no one gets close to the level of usability of K 9. Keep up the good work!

	   I was not happy with the stock email app. I was constantly having to close and reopen the app so it would refresh my inbox. K9 mail refreshes without any issues. Also it is very customizable. 2 of my favorite items, instead of having black text on a white screen, they have a dark mode which is a dark screen background with white text. Saves on battery life. Also you can put different folders in to categories and view only those categories you choose. This app ROCKS!!!

	   I wasn't even given a choice of whether or not to install it. You can no longer delete several emails at once. Very time consuming to open each email to delete it. I find the color coded letters distracting. I wish there was a way to turn it off.

	<comment>
	   has many useful features such as being able to fetch mail even if android is in stamina mode. Just unfortunately the let down is that hotmail subfolders are not supported. The New update received today is visually a great improvement and have upgraded my rating for this app. A future feature would be to have a quick reply (prewritten message ready) when responding to emails.

	   What would make you think there would be overwhelming interest in adding the return email addresses of all the junk mail received to the contact list? More over why that in place of the select button that allowed us to delete a group of emails concurrently? I don't have time to open and delete each unsolicited commercial email I receive individually... guess I'll be looking for a new email app in my spare time again. &lt; frustrated Sigh!&gt;

	<comment>
	   **UPDATE** To turn off those ugly colorized letters, go to Settings->Global->Display and uncheck "Show contact names". I restore the star rating to "5". If I wanted the app to look like the Gmail app, I would just use the Gmail app because it's pre-installed on every Android device. The colored letters on the mail display are huge and take up far too much real estate on my phone screen. Yeah, I understand that there is a need to satisfy the tablet owners also, but this "feature" is ridiculous. Is there a way to turn it off?

	<comment>
	   Still the best mail app around. Although, with the latest update, the 'chip' no longer shows as faded once the message is marked as read. It's a little annoying - can this be added back in as a setting? The new coloured contact avatars are also too loud - makes it too busy when trying to quickly scroll through a folder for an email.

	   Looks just like mobile Gmail, which is why I downloaded this in the first place, because the mobile gmail is atrocious. With the update, lost is the more professional look in favor of picture pages for illiterate children. Insert sad face here.

	<comment>
	   I've been using this app for a few years and liked it. However, the latest release changes my custom settings? It has these color coded boxes containing the first letter of each sender. If I remove the setting, the sender and subject are crushed to one line and unreadable in the message list. Please fix. This app is not usable in this manner.

	<title>Used to be great - no more</title>
	<comment>
	   All K9's great features are outweighed by 3 major defects: 1. It's become so slow as to be virtually unworkable. Mass-deleting spam, for example, now takes 5 minutes when it used to take 30 seconds. 2. It's now hugely unstable. Frequent crashes are the norm, and filling in the reports is pointless as there's no-one to reply. 3. Because it's open source, there's no customer support to ask for help. And if I had the time to trawl forums for info, then I wouldn't have the problem in the first place!

	   Simply would not update the inbox after a day, I raised the size of messages allowed and the number, but it polled and returned nothing so with regret uninstalled. It was good while it lasted but it didn't last long.

	   I've been using this app for three generations of android, currently running under KitKat on a nexus 7 and moto g. As a single email client managing five different email accounts, it's smooth and very effective.

	   Its one of the best email apps I've ever had. Is it possible to have a "move to" feature so I can move accidentally deleted emails from the trash folder back to the inbox? I find this happens to me most when I select all messages and delete them but I forgot there's a few I don't want to delete.

	   UI could be better and needs a preview widget. I used K9 for a good while but eventually switched over to SolMail because of the two things mentioned above. Never uninstalled K9 because I hope future improvements can allow me to switch back (and be done with SolMail, which has functionality issues). I'll keep my eyes open for an update, guys. Being able to swipe away unwanted emails would be a good start.

	   Worked consistently well until, one time only, it said, "Sorry, temporarily stopped working" after I tried to send one of the most important emails of my life to my fiance. All lost. A lesson learned? Yes. However, I will be returning to my native email app. As I say, good until it failed.

	<title>Tired of sending mail via the wrong account.</title>
	<comment>
	   I use three different outgoing accounts, but only one incoming IMAP. Two of the three accounts forward to the IMAP account, and the sent/received by fields are left unchanged. Every other email application that I use on ANY platform can identify the address in the TO field and correctly select the reply address to use accordingly. K-9 consistently chooses to send using the account that the email was received through. I should not have to select the correct from email address every single reply.

	   It's such a good app, it has a lot of features, that stock app couldn't provide. But it's laggy and has a lot of bugs such as folder list in gmail acc, problems with msgs deleting, default send acc settings. Also, it has scary icon, and may be it'll be good to add some themes.

	   Two issues which are show stoppers for me. 1) Email addresses are only autofilled from the adress book. The standard email program, on the otherhand, would also keep a list of people I previously sent/recieved from. I don't want to add everyone of them to my contacts. 2) Adding attachments not so get. It 'completes' the action with MyFiles which does actually allow you to attach. Should have its own file picker.

	<comment>
	   Back when all I had was a Droid 2, this was a stellar app that had Gmail beat. Then I got a Nexus 4 & 7 last year and switched to the Gmail app which I used up until a 2 days ago when I decided to give K9 another go. While I am pleased with the updates to the K9 app interface, I have knocked 2 stars from my previous 5 star rating, the lack of device setting sync and notification sync. If I clear a notification on one device it should automatically clear on another. Needs vacation responder control as well

	<comment>
	   Been using for a while now and it works well on my Nexus 4. Don't really like the gmail emulation with the tiles but that's just my taste. It's stable and does everything you need and is easily configured. Needs a reply/forward option in landscape mode as this is missing, and also doesn't seem to receive automatically when a message is sent. Hence 4 stars.

	<comment>
	   I don't normally write reviews but I felt compelled to after using this app. I was getting very frustrated with the built in android email app for many reasons (the main two being the inability to move mail to other folders and only storing sent mail locally without the option to save to my imap sent items folder). I downloaded several email apps before finding k9 but none of them were very good. K9 is amazing! Someone mentioned it on a forum so I gave it a go. It does everything I need and more.

	   After trying various mail apps that either crashed or would not register my email accounts, I came across the highly rated K-9 mail app. It is easily customizable with an intuitive interface and reading and replying to messages (which I do on a daily basis) is a breeze. That is, until it started acting buggy with my Gmail account and I was unable to send or receive mail. On to other apps...

	   Thank you K9! After the Kitkat "upgrade" couldn't display pic attachments on regularly used email app on Nexus 7. K9 allows me to display them again. KitKat upgrade also caused messages to be deleted on the server after deleting them on Nexus. K9 fixed that problem too..Also didn't have a "select all" feature and had to tap each email to select and delete. K9 took care of that too! Easy to use and set up! Thank you for a great product.

	   Brilliant email client that resolves all the shortcomings of tjs android native mail app. Especially great if you have many accounts and a lot of folders. Let's you choose custom sent, draft, spam etc .... And let's you synch only select folders. Read the instructions to set up advanced folder setting. Easy to do once you know how. Highly recommend this app.

	<comment>
	   I use K-9 for all my other email accounts except for Gmail. I think the Gmail client works best for it - and I like many of it's features. I wish K-9 was more polished on it's user interface. On my Galaxy Tab 2 7.0", it's nearly impossible to click a select/check box without opening the message. Maddening when you just want to check off a batch of messages and mark them read or delete them. Imagine the frustration on a phone screen. As a graphic designer, I'd be HAPPY to contribute to the interface dev to improve this.

	   I am a big open source fan so really appreciate the continued development of K-9. It's a bit overcomplicated with loads of options as often happens with FOSS and the aesthetics could be better (especially the icon which sorry to say makes my eyes bleed). These issues aside however this is a really solid email client, I take my hat off to the devs and hope to see K-9 evolve.

	   Finally, I can make sense of my gmail and view it in a classic inbox style that let's me open emails as they should be, without those nonsense conversations!! I love k9 mail, it let's you group all of your email accounts into one handy place, and batch editing of large amounts of spam is a breeze. This app is FAR superior to the Ymail and Gmail apps. I recommend this to anyone wishing for a more old school approach to your android mail.

	   I've tried GMail, and the mail thing that came with my S-3. Neither was quite good enough. Both lacked little things in the way of customization that made a huge difference to me. K9 does all I wish it to! There may be better mail software out there, however I see no need to install dozens of them at the same time to compare, in the perhaps forlorn hope of finding something that would provide any extra functions, or customization than I already have with K9. You won't be dissatisfied.

	   This is a very good application and I can finally get the same control as I have with my mutt setup. The only feature, which I'd like to see is unified sent, drafts and thrash folders. And I'd like to be able to hide the unified all mail folder. Thanks for a very good and useful app. The devs had added a gmail like letter avatars, which is nice, but the above feature is still desired.

	   If you have a nexus 5 with KitKat 4.4 and your messages are blank, disable auto fit in global settings. Great free email solution overall. Don't give a 1 star just because a new version of OS broke something, and you've been using it perfectly for years. That's not fair.

	<title>Perfect for pop 3</title>
	<comment>
	   I only need it for my office's POP3 e-mail so I can't comment on the other features. On my Galaxy s3 phone it is much better than the awful Samsung stock email client which is a little buggy and annoying to use. For me K9 is just perfect, I can't think of a single complaint. Affirmative!

	   Open source, handles g mail and business mail, and has a keen user interface. Slightly worse than the native gmail app, but it makes up for it in flexibility.

	<title>Anti spam function not working</title>
	<comment>
	   I tested K9 because stock email does not handle spam for my Pop mail. K9 seems to say it can flag emails and it even has a Spam folder. Unfortunately it doesn't do anything. Even the some basic filtering functions would get rid of most of the spams. Most of the other features are not useful because I don't want to manage another email system in addition to my laptop.

	<comment>
	   It is a great program. The only problem is i cannot attach local files. Only local files i can attach is music, photos etc and files on cloud like dropbox, drive. No option to choose local files. Am i using it wrong or is it just like that. I am using Galaxy Note 8.0 with Android 4.2.2. If this problem can be solved then it is a 5 stars!

	   I installed the K9 app and it works fine as long as I am on a wifi connection or the wifi is turned off completely. If the wifi is on and I am not on a connection, I get a " couldn't log in check username and password" notification message. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app and also did a factory reset on the phone but the notification messages continued so I have uninstalled the app.

	   The app is useless with Gmail as there is no feature to archive or star a message in one click - it requires three clicks. Also no swiping control. On the bright side, lots of settings which are quite helpful.

	<comment>
	   Seriously can you please consider a proper icon for such a powerful application, that Icon is out off sorts.. And it would make a professional look like a joke. I think its about time that Google puts a stop to these silly icons. Really make it square and nice so that it flows with the android UI.. Or simply put a nice envelope.. This is the best mail client around but is in need of a real icon that makes it look real too. Why cant developers just put icons that match with the android UI..

	   So much better than the standard android one. Just installed the latest (free) version and haven't found any issues yet. My only gripe is the limited attachment feature. You can only add from Gallery or Music. Why not add a browse button so I can find a PDF or something? The workaround is to be viewing the item then share with K9 but that's no good if I'm already eolying to a mail!
