	  Love it. Has pretty much all the information on the geocaching website that is available for non-premium members, except for trackables. Really like the built-in GPS.

	<comment>
	   This is my go to app for geocaching. Used it for years, and it keeps getting better. After the recent change of icons on the live map and the late 2016 fix, the app seems to crash A LOT! Especially when using the OSM: Cyclemap. Have to kill and restart the app all the time now. Crossing my fingers for a fix.

	<comment>
	   Would be a great app is there was a setting to change the text size, but several years after I reported it was unusably small on a hi-res 7" tablet nothing has been done. The authors obviously care nothing for accessibility. My eyes aren't that bad, this is the only app I can't use out of literally hundreds I've tried. All the other apps I use now either scale properly or have a text size setting, this if the only one that does neither.

	   I just started geocaching today and didn't like the fees on the other app. However, this app is unintuitive and only opens a settings page. Eventually it opened via another website to reveal a skeletal site missing much information. A quick uninstall followed.

	   As a casual geocacher I resent how geocaching makes you buy a premium membership if you want to look at caches (I'm sorry, but the free caches they let you see don't cut it). Thanks to this app for making them accessible.

	   c:geo is a full featured geocaching app that has the tools to do just about everything with geocaching once you learn where those tools are. The lack of updated documentation means you have to tinker with the app to figure out how to get things done. You want to add an image? The option is there, but you have to find it. Log a tracking bug? Sure can, once you know where to look. It's a great app, learn to use it and you will have the best geocaching app offered on Android.

	  This is the absolute only way to go if you're Android. Long story short, the "other" app will cost you an annual membership to get anywhere near the amount of information that you get here for free. This is the old app, but as long as it works, it's the way to go.

	   My go-to app. I have tried them all. I can open my pocket queries in C:geo! So easy to use! Hint: when caching with your smartphone turn off your wifi. That radio interferes with the GPS radio and it can throw off the coordinates.

	   Hands down the number one geocaching app I've ever used. Packed full of features and goodies hardcore geocachers need. I love the ability to change where the coordinates are for mystery caches. It can't show you caches of a specific DT rating like the official app can but it can load custom maps which is a huge benefit and data saver. I love this app. I can't geocache without it (no gpsr yet) so it's my go-to choice. No social features but that's where the official app steps in.

	   This app takes you by the hand (that holds ur phone) and using a few of your brain cells, takes you right straight to the cache. It's up to your own eyes to actually see it. Chances are, the app will provide you with that too. If you can't find a cache with this app, give up!

	   There is no shortlink to Home screen. It takes a lot of actions to get there after browsing through caches and their details. Filter would be much better as multiple choice.

	<comment>
	   Still a great app. Just missing a few things I would like, such as a the option of having a ruler tool to quickly measure distances from the map, or most important ***a cache list of saved offline cache logs*** I always log as found and write a quick note to save offline to save battery and data, and then properly log the cache when my trip is down. This is really hard when the history doesn't show crap. It displays it out of order, misses half of them, and shows some from b.c. or Quebec a year ago...why?

	   Impossible to read an interpret the captcha images. Way to difuse and to many letters to decode. Impossible to understand so i gave up after 30 attempts... you do know that this is just geochaches you try to protect? Feels like logging into som pentagon thingy. Reduse to max 5 letters and use a diferent type image. More than enough security for something like this.

	<comment>
	   Dropped one star . Past two updates have had issue with zooming/out buttons . The zoom out button (-) will stay highlighted and will fight me by zooming out when I try to zoom in. This happens quite often .I have to quit app and restart to stop it.

	<title>Very good alternative to the official app</title>
	<comment>
	   The official app is unusable if you're a non-premium member. But this one provides a very good alternative. The only issue I see with this app is the map. It's slow and quite often shows caches that should not be visible (disabled, found or premium if you're a regular member). You need to zoom out and back in to "fix" it. It also lacks the feature to refresh stored caches while in the map view.

	<comment>
	   Great app but has a few issues. One is that my found caches often don't show up as found on the map so I have to reload them by opening the cache to they show up as found. A few days later they are back to not found. Also many caches show up as grey question marks rather than the little icon for traditional or multi and so on. So I have to click on every single one to see what they are. Highly annoying. Other than that it's a great app

	  I installed this and tried logging in. No joy. I opened an account online and went back to the app, thinking I could use these details to login with. No joy. I played around with the app to see if I had missed an option or a page or something. No joy. This app looks the business, but when it comes down to it is "utterly rubbish with 0 functionality". Normal login doesn't work, Facebook login doesn't work. The whole thing is broken, it would seem. Update after seeing developer's response: There's no way I will be looking at any newbie guides: if the functionality is so complex that it needs an in depth guide to teach you how to use it, I suggest your development team are way behind the times with what is currently accepted as 'good functionality'. It should be simple, intuitive, and not require special instructions. Geo Caching is hardly rocket science, and nor is the art of making good apps these days (or so my developer friends tell me). You retain 1 star - and that's generous.

	<comment>
	   After update I have no caches shown on live map. I have to look at cache close to me then map it. I like opening live map and finding that way. Change It back please

	<title>Way better than the Geocaching app</title>
	<comment>
	   I can do various caches that were unavailable to me with the Geocaching app. C:geo lets me view caches with all different ratings, & all different types of caches too (except supposedly premium content-I don't have a membership to geocaching-but I haven't found a cache I couldn't access yet-unlike geocaching's app). Tracking is better on this app too- no more wandering aimlessly for jumping gps signals! Only drawback is that my friends using Apple can't use c:geo, so how are we supposed to cache together?

	<title>Everything good but... Messaging would be nice. Also, the fact that we have to place (offline) maps on the internal storage sucks.</title>
	<comment>
	   It's not as if this would be that hard... A nice feature would be a message when you start the app like, DIDN'T YOU FORGET YOUR PEN DUMBASS? Because I always do. :) And third, which u guess is much more difficult, would be some kind of "check refresh" button for the caches, meaning it checks what there is to refresh, shows it to the user, and he can then decide if he wants to refresh. Keep it up!

	<comment>
	   I'm not paying to find things hidden by other geocachers. It's a free game and u want to charge to play it. Might as well use the actual geocaching app as its 10x better. Still all apps want you to pay for a so called premium geocache which is the same as a normal geocache. Greedy developers.

	   This app is so great that even if I didn't like android (I love it though) I still would never go to iPhone just because they don't have this app. I am still learning features I didn't even know existed on it and each time those features make geocaching even more efficient and easier to do. Easily my favorite.

	  The latest update is great, thanks for the continued support of this app. It has so far outperformed the official app in almost every area. Going to give the android wear utility a try as soon as I get the chance.

	<comment>
	   Even using offline map, renders slowly. Bug with Personal Note feature, with larger note will often duplicate the text, with double hyphen in between. Which is annoying. Wish the X and checkmark buttons were farther apart, tapping on X by mistake if not really careful. Still has the best features, but I use the other 2 apps (official and GCDroid) as well, especially for the live maps.

	<title>Hide premium option?</title>
	<comment>
	   Great app! My favourite but haven't used it for a few years. Installed again and the results are peppered with premium caches. Wish there was an option to tick so that premium caches are hidden from the map/results. I don't geocache enough to warrant premium membership so guess I have to make do with messy search results.... =(

	   This is definitely the best app out there for geocaching. The only thing I dislike is how long it takes to update which caches I have found. Also, it occasionally shows premium caches even though I am not a premium member.

	   This app is fantastic! When we get a "bouncy compass" because of the GPS coordinates, we get the best results by using two or more phone to narrow down the area.

	   I have been using this app to cache for years. Even when I quit for a while, it still kept a home on my phone. This app lets you enjoy your hobby spontaneously and is feature rich. The few things I could complain about have just been fixed. If you are a cacher, give this app a shot. You will be happy you did. Any chance you can bring out a version for the Samsung Gear smart watch?

	  I love this app. Unlike the other app I tried, this got me so close to the cache that I felt like I was cheating. I can locate nearby caches, find them and log my find all from this app and while still in the field.

	   This was a fantastic app and still works great on my Samsung Note 4. However, it refuses to log in on my Samsung Fame. Initially it was ok but now it refuses to. I've tried everything, including uninstalling and reinstalling the app, all to no avail. Not happy.

	<comment>
	   The app is amazing. It let's you access every cache, regardless of whether you are a premium member or not! The only thing that I would suggest is a more elegant material design (so that it doesn't look like Android 4) and the ability to describe your log with "found it" and etc.

	   After the last update the distance is wrong. Expecting the length of the GC it comes up with the distance from where i am now. We would like both. But please keep the info the same as the official site! It does make my geocaching indeed paperless. But it could do with some improvements. But if all is loaded and stored it works fine during the hunt.. Thanks

	   Accurate within10'. Worse aspect is the compass has a bad habit of resetting and sending you elsewhere so you may walk in a 30' circle trying to figure out its pinpointed target. But its fun, and a great reason to check out the area around you! I have a blast "treasure hunting" with my son.

	<comment>
	   Awesome. I use this far more than I use the traditional geocaching app. It's got so much more functionality. May need to get used to it, but in the end, it's the best.

	  One of the best, however; had to remove it from my main tablet. Even with no defaults set it likes to open when I am importing ebooks for my reader. .mobi files and the like. It tries to import them to C:Geo as a GPX file for some reason. Very irratating.

	   I've been using this app for a number of years. It's not add accurate as a dedicated hand held gps but it's close. I've had a few issues with accuracy that have had me walking in circles. So it's not my primary go to device. But it gets the job done (sometimes) in a pinch.

	   This app is the perfect companion for the avid geocacher. You can geocache completely offline. It has offline maps and cache storage...you can add way points to a cache if you need...and log all your finds. All without interweb. The only thing you can't do (understandably) is hide caches.

	   Functionality is 5 stars, with many features you wont find in the official app... but the user interface is 1 star. I wish the UI was as clean as the official app. This app is so ugly, that unfortunately, I primarily use the official app...

	   UPDATE: I tried logging caches on 05/11 and it wouldn't let me log ANYTHING... Tried to post my saved logs today and it's STILL giving me an error message. Don't know what happened but this app is useless to me now. ORIG REV: It's not as cosmetically pleasing & excludes some features (private msging) but it's free and actually shows ALL of the geocaches, unlike the official app which requires you to pay ten dollars for limited caches. I'd like to see terracache added to the account list for a 5 star review!

	   Offline maps and caches support could be simplified, but this is still the easiest geocaching app. It shows lots more caches than the official app, and feels better. I'd like it to work better with my Holux Bluetooth GPS device if possible!

I sent an email to support several days ago and haven't received any information yet. It's a good app so I am wanting to upgrade. Every thing takes me to the donations page. I don't want to donate until after I upgrade. It's frustrating that support has not responded to my email.

	  A very useful geocaching app, I stopped looking for anything else a long time ago. It has gotten more and more stable over the years - I have been using it since I got my first Android phone back in 2010 - and it is almost perfect: Off-line cache lists and off-line maps are especially useful, they save a lot of data. There are still some minor glitches, but mostly it is stable. Furthermore it is a free, and nowadays it is open source, so whenever Groundspeaks decides to modify their web pages it only takes a few hours until someone fixes the things that were broken by them.

	<title>Best geocashing app</title>
	<comment>
	   Granted, I am fairly new to geocashing, but I love this app. I can store my pocket query on my Samsung note 2 and cache off line in Rockies or on the road with no problem. I can access all the logs for that cache. I use the satellite map almost exclusively. My mentor has even given me her old Garmin, and I never use it. Lol. Thank you for such a fine free app.

	   Worked super well while I was living in France, and was the only app I ever needed. Now that I am using it in Ireland it is having trouble finding the geocaches in the area, despite having 4g coverage. Also, now it keeps displaying my found/hidden caches, kinda annoying. Otherwise it is a super all round app.

	   Adding an option to ignore caches would be great. There are many caches that I don't plan to go or they are too difficult, but they keep showing up. Also using the internal maps, you can't zoom in enough. It should let you go closer like you can do with Google maps.

	<comment>
	   No negatives... I recommend this app to everyone with an android who asks me about geocaching. One feature that I didn't realize was available right away is the satellite imagery overlay from the 'map selections'... I do a lot of urban geocaching and this is a HUGE help for me since my GPS signal bounces all over the place.

	<comment>
	   I love this app. It's perfect except for one thing- It doesn't let you see all of the log entries for the caches, especially if there are a lot. Those entries contain vital info to find caches sometimes and I hate that I have to leave the app to find them. Something else that would be nice is the ability to upload .gpx trails onto the maps. Already the best geocaching app, but change add that stuff and it's 5 stars for sure.

	   No update available. Whenever I log on it just shows 0 geocache available. Before it did that, it would get the coordinates wrong. It used to be a great, reliable and accurate app. It no longer is. Given this, should I trust the premium app? I guess not.

	  This app was amazing and I have been using it for a couple of years. Unfortunately, recently it won't log me on, so when I'm out, I can't log the caches I find. I've read someone else has had the same problem and even reinstalling it doesn't work. It's a shame that something that was so good is now a let down.

	<comment>
	   I started with the .com app and didn't want to move. I am particular when it comes to change on my apps. All my friends kept telling me I was missing out by not using this app, and it wasn't until recently the .com app I paid ten dollars for was being replaced with a free pretty app with less functionality. Knowing the c:geo team and telling them of my gripes and complaints I switched over and I can tell you this: Why oh Why didn't I do it sooner. It is an all in one must have app period!

	  Great app, easy to use and navigate through. I love being able to store caches in different folders and enabling and disabling the live map when I need to. *Is there a way we can edit our logs once it is sent?* Other than that, I enjoy using this app and it has helped us to find lots of geocaches! Great work! Thank you for this app!

	   I used to use this app a lot as a free alternative to geo caching pro, and it was brilliant. But after a year without the app I re-downloaded it to give it another go and I am so disappointed in what it has become. If you are looking for an alternative to the official geo caching app then don't bother with this. It seems that with success came greed for c:geo.

	<title>Mostly OK but missing features</title>
	<comment>
	   Easy to use, however, some features are missing like managing watch lists (you can add caches to a watch list but there's no way to see the list...), remove disabled caches from map view. However, after checking out the other geocaching apps out there, this one is WAY more feature rich and useful.

	   Bis zu dem Update vor knapp einer Stunde hat die App super funktioniert. Seitdem st眉rzt das Programm in einer Tour ab, wenn ich auf die Live-Karte gehe. Sobald das behoben ist, gibt es von mir auch wieder 5 Sterne. Inzwischen wurde das Problem behoben und die 5 Sterne sind wieder gesichert. Danke f眉r die schnelle Reaktion

	  Nachdem die offiziellen Geocaching-Apps eingestellt wurden und stattdessen eine "neue" noch viel schlechtere App ver枚ffentlich wurden, habe ich mir c:geo angesehen. Ich muss ehrlich sagen, dass c:geo alle Funktionen hat, die ich beim Cachen brauche und frage mich, warum ich nicht schon viel fr眉her gewechselt habe. Einzig die Optik ist etwas "alt" . Ansonsten erhalten sie hier jede Menge Funktionen und dazu ist sie noch kostenfrei!

	  One of the best geocaching apps on the Play Store. Better than the official app: - Doesn't prevent you from accessing difficult caches if you're non-premium - Makes it super easy to see when you last attempted a cache / when you found it / which friends you found it with! - Just generally far more feature-rich than the official app. Official one looks nicer, but they've sacrificed functionality and features to do it, making this my preferred app now. Will be using this one instead of the official app going forward.

	   I love this app, but after a recent update, any attempt to use a map connected feature causes a crash when trying to zoom. Auto crash reports have been sent to Google apps. Hope this will get fixed soon. ... Follow up: changed from OSM mapnik to Google map and so far no crash.

	<comment>
	   I've been using this app for a few years now and I'm totally happy with it. The official free app seems to withhold lots of non-premium-only caches, wanting you to pay for the full app, but this has always been full access. It also has direct access to emailing COs, viewing trackable info, offline storeage, searvhea, sorting, and all sorts of things considered an 'upgrade' to the offical app. I can't praise this highly enough! Love it!

	   I use this as well as the official app. To be fair the official app has a cleaner ui but as a basic member this app allows me to grab and log the occasional difficult cache along the way. I recommend c:geo. Download both apps and get the best of both worlds. Edit : I updated my account to premium and still use this in preference to the official app although I do flip between the two.

	   Use garmin gps most of the time but like this one when I want to view more posts, or sometimes when I want to view the website for pictures. Always works great.

	   Constantly being updated, easy to use, overall great app. You know you're doing well when your third party Geocaching app is rated higher than the official, $10 one from Groundspeak.

	   I have not been out to use this since the update but I love this app. I haven't used the intro geocaching app since I downloaded this one. Before I upgraded to the phone I wanted I made sure it would download this app because I would not go without it. Thank you to the developers!!! :)

	  I've tried a few of these and this is the best out there, the bonus is it's free. It's not quite as graphically sweet as the Geocaching app but it's functionally far superior.

	<comment>
	   More and more it seems as if I am using this app more so than my handheld GPS when finding urban caches. App offers everything that the Geocaching app does just in a different format. And the fact that it is free is fantastic. I tell every geocacher I know to try this app first when just starting out. The fact that new updates changes with the times shows that the makers are in tune with what they are doing. Keep it up guys

	   I'd give this app 10 stars if I could. I loved this app before the latest update but now I don't think I could ever live without it! It's incredibly intuitive and user friendly. Since I'm a premium geocaching member, I create pocket queries quite often. The latest update now loads my pocket queries easier than I could ever imagine! Kudos to the developers! Keep up the good work!

	<comment>
	   I have been using this app for a years now. It really has gotten much better throughout the year. When I first started using it, it didn't have enough features. I would like to suggest features. I would like to add photos when logging trackables. Maybe be able to add more then one photo. A blue smiley for logged DNFs. (THANKS FOR THE BLUE SMILEYS!) I recommend this app to every Android user. Another thought. Being able to highlight caches that are at the top of out need to find list.

	   I tried the option to upload offline field logs through export. It said it was done successfully however it never reached the geocaching website, and none of my finds had yellow smiley faces. I tried importing the export .txt file directly to the geocaching field notes page and it showed 0 successful. Maybe your exporting in the wrong format?

	<comment>
	   I switched last May from iPhone to Android (Galaxy S6). I had the official app before, but downloaded this app because I didn't want to pay for the official app again. I have had nothing but problems with this app. It won't load caches in my map, and in all honesty it's a frustration to navigate. It makes me incredibly sad because my fianc茅 and I love geocaching, and he's the one who introduced me to it, but using this app is just a headache every time we go on a hunt.

	<comment>
	   The compass on Moto G is even more dysfunctional then it was before. Now it has no idea which way it's oriented, originally it just occasionally crashed, now it only occasionally works. Honestly it's always had major issues with this phone and no one is fixing that.

	   This is the only way my wife and I cache. We love using c:geo. This is better that paying for an app. I can log all the caches that we look for even save them for better a search when there is no service with the phone thanks for fixing all the issues that I have had so far.

	   This showed exactly zero geocaches in my area. This I know for a fact to be untrue, as I have geocached before in the very extensive park/trail system near my home. No matter how many times or ways I changed my settings, nothing appeared. Hence the name above. I am not new to this and consider myself tech savvy, but this has left me frustrated and scratching my head. Perhaps I will have better luck installing another app? Fingers crossed!

	<comment>
	   Experienced Geocachers will love this feature-rich app. Can be used for other platforms as well (eg, Opencaching.de). Supports online maps (including satellite) and popular Mapsforge offline maps (saves batteries and money). Almost perfect if additional log entries could be downloaded. However, it's still the best app available! c:geo is all you need for a great Geocaching experience. Comes for free and has no ads. Please donate!

	<comment>
	   Wish all apps were this well-maintained. Especially glad for no 'special permissions'. Use c:geo more than the Nuvi or the Oregon. The maps are up to date, and easy to navigate. My only complaint is the compass needle not pointing in the right direction - but I think that is a function of my phone, not c:geo. I tell all new cachers about c:geo!!

	  A really great application; while travelling abroad without any Internet connection, it allowed me to use Geocaching as a fun way to explore the visited cities without having to rely on fickle free wifi or use a portable rental hotspot. And since the map is pretty nice, I found myself using it even when not searching for caches, just to get around ;)

	   Great app, covers pretty much all of my caching needs. Only problem is my Google Nexus seems to hate it. My phone freezes and needs to be restarted very often using C:geo. It only happens when using this app and it happens very very often...hate it...makes me want to leave my phone in a cache.

	   I currently have over 200 caches stored in my offline folders. How can I transfer those to a new phone without having to load 200 plus cache pages again?

	   I'm new at geocaching, but this app does basically everything from what I can tell. It is *great*, and is free (although I plan to donate) and open-source while so many geocaching apps I saw are subscription-based. Very much recommended.

	<comment>
	   I love this app, pure & simple. It is easy & intuitive & is a must have for any geocacher using an Android device. But...this app is a resource hog effectively draining my battery so beware that extended use may end your caching prematurely. I would still give it 5猸? even with the high battery drain, however it is the amount of data this app uses which brings the rating down a notch. With no Wi-Fi in most geocaching areas, the amount of data the app uses when searching for caches is excessive. Time for a GPS

	   Very good app. Runs smoothly and syncs well with the geocaching website. I wish there was options to see if a trackable was in a cache when you have it loaded, but that is a minor thing and doesn't detract from the rating.

	   This app works great for caching, and loads all of the caches around you. The only issue I found, was not being able to log a find through the app. This just posts notes instead. With that being the only fault I have found, this is a solid app great for beginners or experts.

	   I've used it for a year now and have found nothing better. The official app is miles behind. With offline map compatability, ability to store PQs and other caches in lists the novice or dedicated cacher need look no further. Developer support is also A1 via Facebook page.

	  Compass doesn't rotate on Sony Xperia Z Ultra with stock Lollipop ROM. Makes it difficult to find caches without using external mapping app. Useless until that's fixed. EDIT 23/8/15: Devs blaming it on the firmware. However, from GitHub it looks like you're incorporating version 7.5 of Google Play Location Services. The Xperia is running 7.8, which is the latest available. Other compass apps which are using the right version of Google Play Location Services are working ok.

	  Best app I've found for Geocaching, and it's free. Shows you all of the information that you need for a cache, like size, logs and hints. Finding the cache is easy, you can use compass view or map view to close in on the coordinates. The GPS works really well, the map is usually spot on. It easily lets you post logs to a cache, including attaching pictures. Map view and sorting makes finding caches near you really easy. You can also search for caches by GC, user who placed, use who found etc. You can save caches for offline use, which is really handy if you're heading out to somewhere where you're unlikely to get signal. If you're a premium member, it still let's you find and log premium caches.

	   Love this app but for the last week, when I go to the live map, the caches will not load. I've verified that the filter is set to all caches. There are no updates for it currently. I've uninstalled and reinstalled without resolution. Any suggestions?

	   Not used in three years and I see it has not improved. in fact it's got slower... yes it works now but so slow to download caches... maybe the developer wants to take a look at munze app... much better...

	   Overall a very good app. Gives me all the details and options I need. Interface could be a little more user friendly, like when attempting to upload pictures with a log, or the option to edit logs I just made. Would like to see my current cache count at all times without having to back out to the main screen or check previous logs, but that's just a wishlist item.

	   Is a bold statement I know but it's so great and easy to use. It's especially handy to use with an offline map and caches stored in the device. You really don't need cell coverage at all. I even tried on my old handy tablet and it worked great to do it offline like that. Thank you team c:geo.

	   Ever since I switched phones this app has been giving me grief. Compass points in the opposite direction to where I'm supposed to go. Maybe if I uninstall and then reinstall could help? Otherwise past smartphones have been great with this app.

	   So I'm running the moto x. I'm not sure whether the latest version causes a freeze when the screen rotates or whether it happened after the update to 5.1. It is really annoying when you're trying to keep maps on screen in areas of low signal!

	   c: geo is the best geocaching app. I've tried 3 others including official GC, and nothing beats it. Great with GPS Status, too. Update takes a little adjustment for long-time users, but now it works like other phone apps.

	<title>Alternativa gratuita all'app ufficiale</title>
	<comment>
	   L'app ufficiale di Geocaching non permette di accedere a molte cache se non pagando (9 dollari!), mentre tali cache sono accessibili dal sito web. Quest'app sfrutta il sito web per proporre tutti i contenuti senza limitazioni. Da migliorare per貌 l'interfaccia grafica...

	   Every time I try to send my log it always says "Download of data in progress... Please try again in a few seconds, or check your internet connection." But I switch between my regular data and WiFi and I still get the same response. What do I have to fix on my settings?

	<comment>
	   I've had this app for a couple years now and love it. I tried one other geocaching app but this one takes the cake. It's the best geocaching app there is!

	   While certainly not perfect (an easy way to refresh all stored caches would be nice, as well as a way to easily store all caches within a certain distance ), this is the best caching app I've found. Used it for years, and it works great.

	   UPDATE: I registered on the dutch website only. Now I've also registered for the .com and it works perfectly! Great! - - - I just installed this, created a user name, authorised it, and logged in successfully. However, the map doesn't show all caches! The nearest one is almost 20km away, although my friend's app says that the city we're in is full of caches! I didn't set any filters so I'm really bummed and confused it doesn't work....

	  I can't get it to go off the settings menu. I can't get it to make an account. If I have to do that through the website then you should say so (put up a box when you tap on one of the log in buttons. And it should tell you if you are new click here and you can get signed up. ) personally I think it should all be able to be done through the app.

	<comment>
	   I downloaded this app to use with the companion app for wear, but the wear navigation keeps crashing. Also this app seems to be more buggy than the official app. Apart from offline storage I see no use for this app if the wear functionality does not get fixed.

	<title>Compass issue</title>
	<comment>
	   I've been using c:geo for about 5 years now and until recently, everything has been working fine. Now, the compass has a big issue that makes it exponentially harder to find a cache: When rotating the phone, the compass either doesn't react at all or moves slowly in random directions. I tried it on both OnePlus One with CyanogenMod 12.1 and with HTC One 4.1.2 Stock. Both have the same issue, so I excluded the gyroscope as an error source. It would be nice if you could explain what's wrong and/or fix it.

	<title>Street names illegible</title>
	<comment>
	   Used to be the absolute best but for a long time now the map is almost illegible. Text on the map renders in tiny font and does not get larger when you zoom in. The map redraws and everything renders tiny again. Using Galaxy S5 running Android 5.0. Will return to 5 stars if this issue can be fixed, otherwise it's useless.

I also like being able to take a photo of my adventure and upload it with my log. Best Geocaching app out there. Thanks, and keep up the great work!

	<comment>
	   I use this app on an LG L7 phone and it has been INCREDIBLY accurate. I have been able to pinpoint caches to the point where I can (and have) reached out and touched them. I have gotten right on top of caches that I just could not see, but the app said it was right in front of me, and by taking a chance and looking at it a different way or looking under something that was right in front of me, the cache would be right there. It depends on the accuracy of the GPS in your phone, but this app is awesome.

	   I can't log any of my entries and it keeps zooming out of the map as far as it will zoom. I had it once before and it was perfect but I uninstalled it to make room for an update and when I reinstalled it, it started doing this. I'm going to uninstall it and then reinstall it again and see if that helps. *** Deleting and redownloading helped.

	<comment>
	   I use the official geocaching app for caching, cause I'm a more "modern" cacher having never owned in actual GPS device. Heck, these days, you could just use your smartphone to go geocaching. But sometimes, it helps to have something more "old fashioned" or something close to it. So I went looking for another app that could look up the coordinates for caches I haven't found, and point me towards them with the use of a compass. If you are looking for the same thing, then this is the app for you!!! Download this app, you won't be disappointed.

	<title>Best Geocaching App</title>
	<comment>
	   This is easily the best app for Geocaching I've ever used! I've used the official app on iPhone, and s ffewew others here and there, but this is the best one I've come across! Been using it for over two years and have no plans on changing. Currently using on HTC One M9.

	<comment>
	   I haven't used it to find any geocaches yet, so I'll update my rating after I do. But for me, the hallmark of a good app is the ability to move to the SD card (I only have 2GB internal memory!), partner that with the small file size and I'm sold. The easy navigation inside the app itself is just a bonus.

	   Live map and compass worked great but wouldn't let me log finds (Login failed). After this update login worked but gps didn't. First I was in France so I restarted my phone and now my location stays at wherever I start the app at. Opened Google map and now that does not work and have not been able to fix yet. Very frustrating

	   I love that you can see every single geocache. On the official geocaching app you cannot see special caches unless you are a premium member. On c:geo I can see every single geocache without a premium membership. And that I love.

	   This app used to be great, but now the map view and live map aren't working for me. On Samsung Galaxy S5. I have to actually save a cache before I can see it's location on the live map, or map view, otherwise it says 0 caches. Please fix!

	   Gets the job done and for the price... Can't be beat! Only issue I have with it is the Track up vs North Up view in maps, wish c:geo could be used with the Track up feature. If it had that would be 5 stars.

	<comment>
	   If you're geocaching, c:geo is an essential app. It works and has handy, neat features, it's flawless, the developers respond to questions, and it's free (though I donated a few bucks because I use c:geo daily). ** Update: This is a terrifically useful geocaching app -- we use it daily. The developers update it regularly with valuable additions (no fluff and still no ads!) and they reply quickly to questions and suggestions. I just sent them another donation. Truly outstanding.

	   I have been using this app for geocaching for just over a week. The design and functionality of the app provides a good experience. It will allow you to save as many geocaches as you like to your phone and you don't even need a data connection to navigate to caches. Well worth downloading for the new and experienced.

	   A while ago I saw a developer discussion whether or not to allow users to force Android to store c:geo data on external SD card. The discussion seemed to conclude favorably, so I am checking for this feature every release for the past half year or so.. Alas, it never came. On my old phone that didn't have emulated "external" SD, I had stored gigs of cache data on my real external 32 GB SD. Alas, more and more phones (not just low cost phones ) bamboozle users and developers with this hellish invention of em

	   Dev is on top of any changes and quick to update. Really appreciate the work that goes into this app. There is a way to donate inside the app- I would encourage everyone to please do so as the devs deserve something for the effort!

	   This is the best out there. There's an official free "intro" app now, but this is still the best you can find. It has so many features and they are all easy to use. Once you give this app a go, you will never go back to any other app, even the official one. The app is constantly getting updates, which is great!

	   This is the cream of the crop. I just supplement my Garmin with this to get the most recent information, but the it's truly fantastic. Don't pay for any apps, just get this one. Only criticism is that I could use a face lift. Strictly cosmetic, however.

	   I've used this for years w/o any complaints! There's no point in looking at any other. Accuracy will always depend on gps/signal strength due to location. Found every cache I looked for, & yes, they still show on the map as found!

	<title>Compass is way off after updates</title>
	<comment>
	   Before the last 2 updates my LG G3 would get me within 2 ft of a cache. Now, it's always off by 15-30 ft. I've missed numerous caches, I'm sure, because of this. I would have given this 5 stars, because I have used it for years, but, with the update(s), I can only give it 3. :-(

	   Having downloaded & used at least 6 caching apps, including the official 拢7 one which is Shi- no use to me at all -te I can honestly say this is the first one I downloaded & used & has been the best I've used since I first started caching in 2012. It simply 'is'. I've tried all the others that make a noise as you near the cache or have some special thing that makes you a better cacher or is the official app that is basic and appalling for the price they charge for it but c:geo just works, simple as that.

	   Really pleased with this app - however it has a tendency to freeze when using it in live mode over 3G, I have to close the app and restart it in order to unfreeze it - quite annoying when you are trying to find caches. Would have had 5 stars if not for this problem.

	   I have been using this since starting my geocaching and can't recommend this app highly enough. It has a lot of features and amazingly, is totally free. Ability to store an entire map screen of caches when planning a trip is great as is the support of maps.me overlay for offline caching. A step above the rest and a big thanks to the devs.

	<comment>
	   There's only a couple of things I would change. When you do an advance search, it looks everywhere in the world and even though there's a filter for distance, it doesn't work to just find caches close. And there's a couple of little things like that that bug me. But all and all, this is a great app and its free.

	   Help spend quality time with the wife. If we're bored we just get out and go treasure hunting. Gives us time to talk and reflect on things that need to be reflected on. Helps us remember why we love each other every time we use it. Quality time + talking and time well spent equals a good relationship

	   When I access the nearby option it makes me enter one of those encrypted type words every time even if I have just accidentally hit the back button. If I'm on the same device and haven't even closed the app I shouldn't have to do that every time. Besides that the app is fine

	   *I have finally found where I am able to search this.

I don't see the ability to search by size/favorite, etc. and I don't want to buy the groundspeak geocaching app because I feel it is overpriced and dishonest. Not to mention I love this one. I'll change review to a 5 if this is introduced on this app. Thanks,

	   I absolutely loved this app until I downloaded the latest update. All of the icons on the home screen are now invisible, and when you do by chance hit an icon nothing at all works. Have tried uninstalling and reinstalling, restarting the phone and fiddling with settings but nothing has worked. Such a shame, get it fixed soon please! Very pleased to say the app appears to now be fixed so I'm back out there!

	   For some time now (way back when groundspeak broke everything) the app doesn't hide my found/owned caches unless I save them. With over 1500 finds that takes up a lot of room. I'd love to see that work again.

	   This app was great until about 10 minutes ago when it updated and now the app that has never given me trouble, refuses to let me log in. Had to uninstall, reinstall, and relogin to get it to work after last update.

	   A brilliant, brilliant app that has changed the way I geocache for the better! Love the ability to filter by attributes, download records in advance for those no-signal treks, search in half a dozen ways, customize your map displays... A great use of the data and the tech.

	<title>Great app for (offline) caching!</title>
	<comment>
	   Seeing how great this app is for downloading all caches (of a specific or any type) in an area made a friend of mine wish for an android phone instead of his iPhone. Only problem I have with the app is that it sometimes crashes and then does not adhere to the setting "use english" so it switched (in parts) to German which is strange. Some nice possible additions (or missing features): * download the description of trackables * addition of activating the flashlight for night caching (instead of having to switch to an external app) * allow copying parts of comments or direct "create waypoint" function since this is extremely cumbersome right now (full log entries can be copied, but not parts for entering them in the waypoint section) * the friend I was caching with usually uses a "heads-up mode", so the map rotating which seems to not be supported; personally I would not need this. As you can see the list of things which would be cool additions is very tiny since the app is already the probably best caching app I can imagine.

	   This app actually works, and still lets you connect to your geocaching profile! I tried the "official" app first, and found it very lacking, even basic features were locked. This app, on the other hand, works very well, it's easy to use, and it's FREE!

	<comment>
	   Literally the best app to date. I hesitated to down load this initially preferring to stay with "official" Apps. How wrong I was. I feel like this is my new secret weapon in the war on caches. Cannot recommended this enough. Saves hours of planning and enables you to tackle the longest of series and still detour to grab nearby caches. Accuracy is very high and it will often put you on the cache if not near it once you open your eyes! Download this 100% free 100% awesome app and get caching now!

	<comment>
	   Was used to using geosphere on an old iPhone, until the wife dropped it down the loo (wc)... This app is just not as good; but I'll have to get used to it as I've gone Android! My main criticism is a) You cannot set a cache as a 'target' & have all other caches in order of distance from this one, & b) If you log all of your finds 'off-line', when you get connected to wifi, you cannot upload all of your finds without going into each one & uploading individually. Otherwise, the app is not bad at all.

	   Love this app! Hands down my favorite geocaching app. There are some times when it has hiccups, but that's to be expected of just about any app, and they usually resolve themselves quickly. Tons of useful features. A must have for any geocacher using android. Even better than the official app, and it's free to boot!

	<comment>
	   I downloaded this app a few months ago because the original app I had was more unstable than a troubled child on crack. Suffice it to say, I've been incredibly satusfied with this app. It offers a variety of tools that allow my lists to be used to their fullest potential and it syncs directly with the geocache website. It will even keep track of your TB's and let you add or drop them depending on whether or not the issuer logged their cache correctly. This app is awesome and I would definitely recommend it.

	  Absolutely brilliant caching app..... But suddenly I can't enter new coords directly from the compass any more... I have to go via the Any Destination search... Really inconvenient now... OK, read the FAQ, I agree, that's a better way of doing it... Add Waypoint lol :) knew you'd be sensible :D

	   Wen I had an iphone, for the whole 9 months that I did, there was no other option than to buy the Groundspeak Official app. This app works just as well as the real deal! It has come so far since the app first came out, and I am happy there is an option that is free that works. I hate how you buy the groundspeak app in the iTunes store and can't transfer that purchase to your Google store.

	<comment>
	   With the latest patch, I uninstalled and then reinstalled the app. It is back to being a great app again. After the new install I went out and found 20 caches the following day with no problems! Updated9/2014. (Previous post follows) : Works great for a while. Suddenly app stopped being able to login and coordinates were off. While it worked I loved it. Have reinstalled and rebooted android phone but app no longer performs. Same thing happened to a friend.

	   couple of weird things I've noticed since the last few updates. 1) the logbook screen sometimes scrolls like crazy fast to the bottom of the list if you just touch on the lower half and try to scroll only a few rows. 2) the compass doesn't seem to point the correct direction most of the time. It used to be very fluid and lately it's not as good as it used to be. Thanks for the great app tho it's the best out there no comparison.

	<comment>
	   I love this app, it has never let me down until now. Since the last update my location stays on 'last known address' and I have zero satellites. If I reboot my phone it seems to solve the problem, but even then it takes a while to find any satellites and then loses them easily. Other GPS apps I have work fine, what could it be? 5 stars anyway because it is a fantastic app and hopefully this problem will be resolved soon.

	<comment>
	   The app has made great strides in the last few months. There are a couple of things that need to be looked into. 1 when caching a power trail the app continues to crash(message cgeo has stopped working) and I keep having to restart. 2: when in map mode navigation there is no distance indicator, it would be nice if I knew how far I had to go. 3:once I mark a cache with an offline field note there is no way to edit it.

	   It's fairly good. However, the "filter caches by type" function doesn't work at all. Another thing that bugs me is that the cache type sometimes just shows a question mark though that just might be due to bad internet. Other than that, it's fine.

	   Great app to integrate love of caching with daily living. The time I spent finding caches, making maps, and copying info is now spent finding caches because I can do all of those things on the fly. Only downside I found is limitations of my devices battery, which isn't attributable to the app, but a limit nonetheless. TFTA

	   If you want to go geocaching without paying a cent (other than what you paid for your phone in the first place, anyway) then this is the perfect app for you. No fees anywhere to be seen. I don't know how it works with a geocaching premium account, but I suspect it works just as well. Five stars!

	   Love this app. It works better than my Garmin Nuvi for finding caches. You guys rock and are so helpful, THANKS for the manual. I love the waypoint reference points click and go directly to that waypoint. You can even add your waypoints for multi's.

	   Does exactly what it says on the tin! For a freebie this caching tool is my field assistant where i can bring up what Im seeking, all the information an use mapping when my old dinosaur eTrex fails under heavy canopies. Just fantastic... UPDATE: 29/Aug/14 think that is the best update you have put together in the last few months. The only thing missing is a toggle switch to have a "beep" when &lt;15m to GZ. This would be amazeballs!!!!

	   The only option I would really like to see is a setting to hide "premium only" caches from services that use that format. As of now you have to just keep clicking on caches until you find one that doesn't yell at you saying "that cache is for premium members only". I only casually geocache a few times a year and usually with my Garmin 60csx not mobile device, thus it's not worth me paying for a membership I won't really use often. Having the option to hide premium paying member only caches is needed!

	   Filtering of cache type does not always work. Live map and nearby caches are somehow redundant. A list of collected caches would be nice. App does its job though.

	   The app is good except there seems to be no way to log a cache when using it on a Samsung . Needs sorting or making more obvious if I'm being dim and can't find it.

	   This makes it so easy to save interesting caches before heading away from phone coverage. It saves everything from the description to the logs and even the deciphered hint.

	<comment>
	   I went back to geocaching after many years away from the hobby and surprised to find that my metroPCS phone can now take the place of my old Garmin and notebooks, etc.. This app is AWESOME. Make sure you use the compass and GPS functions together when you are onsite and searching for the cache. You don't need any other app to find your current GPS location to do this hobby (or for any other thing for that matter). GET IT NOW!

	   Love the app and love that it's free I use it frequently and it works great but I really don't like the "reCAPTCHA" thing that is IMPOSSIBLE to see correctly! It's very hard to see it to begin with and even harder to have to try to re-type the words that you can barley see while you are moving. Why is this necessary? PLEASE REMOVE THIIS!! That is the only reason for the low rating everything else is great

	   I can no longer see the smiley faces on the map of ones i have found and when I select one, the details of another cache comes up! This use to be my favourite app for geocaching but I'm disappointed that its not doing what it use to. I hope this can be sorted ASAP and then I will give 5 stars!

	<comment>
	   Update: I changed my rating as after clearing my cache the login option appeared. It still didnt find my location so I had to restart my phone to get it to update. I have since located 4 caches. All have been off 5-7 kms. A 5th was not located. Original: I have no login option on app. An IT guru friend and user told me an option is missing in this version (6.1.2014) so there is no way to log in. No login error in faqs to direct me to fix.

	<comment>
	   There are so many bugs in this app. If I try to load more than 3 pages, the page goes blank. It won't search more than 3 pages. Half the time, the app won't work period and just says "logging in" at the bottom, but never logs in. It doesn't matter if I'm at home with Wifi or out on 4G. This app is unstable and only works maybe half the time. It needs LOTS of work to make it a good working app. Once you fix these issues I will rate at 5 stars. Please fix, it's annoying.

	   I'm using a Garminfone for my off network caching and it works well with the built-in lifetime Garmin mapping features. It's definitely a good re-purposing of an electronic device. c:geo has kept up the older Android versions unlike some other apps, as well general improvement of the app itself. The phone's Android version is Eclair.

	   There is no log cache button or option on the new galaxy S5. I can see the logbook but cannot add my own. Please fix. Edit: looking at other reviews, how has c:geo not updated for the 5s yet? Edit: I just received a notification that the developer had replied to my comment from a month ago only to find no reply and the recent update still doesn't fix the issue with the newest, most popular phone on the market not being able to use this app. Time to get a new app I guess :(

	  Transitioned from DROID RAZR Maxx HD running Jelly Bean to Samsung Galaxy S5 running Kit Kat. No menus available, can't log finds, can't switch from metric to imperial and doesn't switch automatically. Was 4 or 5 before and will be again once updated to work properly on new device and O/S.

	<title>Best App for Geocaching</title>
	<comment>
	   This app does everything the Groundspeak app does without the $10 price tag. Once you take the time to familiarize yourself with the app user interface and tweak a few settings the app does exactly what it was designed to do--lead you to the caches. I can't imagine using any other app to go geocaching.

	<comment>
	   So the c:geo app needs a forced reinstall whenever you change any log in info on your geocaching account because the app has no "Login Settings" as the app proclaims while it stupidly tries to infinitely reconnect to the app with the old log in info. This also means all your stored info is gone. And while on the topic of saved information, it would be of great use to have a "Store All" button for offline use when viewing a Nearby List or Map of nearby caches.

	<comment>
	   Excellent app! Works very well offline (important when gcing abroad) -- preloaded caches, preloaded maps (you have to do it yourself though), the works. BTW the mapping app is pretty decent too -- I often open c:geo for a look at the map instead of other mapping apps. I cannot compare it to similar GC apps, because I don't see any reason to try them out. Position averaging would be something nice to add, along with a new GC placement function. Keep up the good work!

	<comment>
	   We've just cleared our 4000th Find. Many of those Finds were accomplished using this App. Over the years this App has become the standard for Geocachers who use their mobile phone. (In fact, Groundspeak recently emulated the features found here.) Don't pay for any other App. On the other hand, when you see the true value of this "free" App, you'll want to donate to the developers as we did.

	  I used to love this app on my old phone, but since I bought my Galaxy S5, I can't find a menu button to allow me to change my settings. Thus, I'm forced to use metric units rather than the good old red, white, and blue imperial units.

	   This is hands down the best geocaching app and it doesn't cost $10. If that isnt reason enough to get it then it also has offline storage of caches and works with several different caching websites. You can log your visits through the app itself and make personal notes on different caches. It has many more features and it works like a charm. I love this app!

	   Being free, it makes geocaching easy to get into, and has been the source of many weekends entertainment for us. Thanks! A couple of things that I would love to see on it are the ability to link caches on a walk so you could have a sort of [prev cache] [next cache] thing, and a "I left my car here" button & marker so you could see where it was on the map.

	  Awesome app. I dont even use my gps anymore. At first i Wasnt sure about the accuracy so i used both cgeo and the gps. And cgeo is just as accurate. I love being able to zoom into different parts of the world and see all the caches in the area. If your a cacher this is the only app to get. Keep up the great work. Thanks

	   I've yet to find a function that I want, that isn't included in this app! I would find it useful if the map rotated, and wasn't always "North Up" though. Any issues that arise from updates are quickly sorted and response from the developers via the forum is swift, helpful & concise.

Mutt experience using Nexus 7 as GPS was not so wonderful (not very responsive) --- unsure what is a device issue versus software. So though GPS user interface could be improved, I love the app anyway.

	  Really good for caching, only scratched the surface of what you can do. I mostly use the offline mode so you don't use up any data allowance. It's great that it pulls all the cache info off the website and saves you having to write loads of details on paper. It's mega juicy on battery if you keep screen and GPS on all the time. Just fire up when close to home you in. That's not the apps fault though. I can easily do 50 caches by doing it this way.

	   I keep the app because I love the layout and features... in hopes one day this app will actually find locations. Each and every time I try, it says this location cannot be found. The compass is also completely off. And now that I am writing it all out, I might as well uninstall. Bummer.

	  Best geocaching app out there. Plus it's free. Free is good. But this app would be great even if it wasn't free. (Just don't tell them!)

	   Ideal software to get into geocaching by phone without splashing out on a gpsr. Sort of try before you buy. I still use it for when I need to download & hunt on the fly.

	<comment>
	   If the ability to post my logs and trackers were included this would be 5 star. Another small suggestion is flashlight within app for night caches. I love everything about this app so far but it's a little annoying to have to post my finds through the website. I can read posts, see available inventory and their posts but can't seem to mark my finds in any way via the app. PLEASE add these features

	<title>Decent geocaching app; found compass workaround</title>
	<comment>
	   The app does a decent job. Wish it was easier to log finds. I have only been able to do it from a long press on the nearby list. The compass on my phone does not work well near the cache. But the lat lon numbers seem to be right. So when you are close walk north-south and East-West until the lat lon numbers match up.

	   Great app that's been improved a lot over the years. It would be nice to be able to 'star' or favourite trackables so we can easily find out the latest location of any trackables we have launched or are following, without having to remember and search for the tb code each time.

	   Have had this app a while and has worked great but since last update its just not working. Is showing all caches, even the ones I've done and the compass sends me in the totally opposite direction!! Just as well I had a back up!! Have uninstalled and reinstalled but still no luck :( will now delete for good and buy the real geocaching app.

	   I love this app and the programmers are quick with fixes and updates. I have also been into munzee and wish there was an option to turn on munzees on the map and store them into databases, but that's just a wish for a feature and in no way lowers my opinion of this great app. :)

	<comment>
	   I walked my dd thru it last night, and she came home today not having used c:geo. It's that ___ menu button. I know now why Samsung is burying it. It's simply not there for inexperienced users. It really rendered the app useless in this case. So, given the vast UI space left with a weirdly deferential transparent background, how about making those buried menu items easier to get to? (If you coded clean classes, it should be pretty easy.) Just plunk the whole shebang right out on the main screen, or put an aptly labelled button to pop it up. Menu is for secret Wifi settings.

My happy faces aren't showing. Coordinates are off by several degrees. I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it. It still isn't working. Is there a fix for this.

	   For the past two updates this app has not worked. I can be standing on top of the cache and the location puts me a good 2/10ths of a mile away. It never goes below showing me as 1/10th of a mile away. I cant rely on this app anymore.

	   Took me awhile to figure this out, but since the options button was replaced on this phone for a recent apps button you can't log caches. However if you hold down the recent apps button for 3 seconds it will act as if you pushed the options button pulling up the menu to log.

	  I updated this app and now it won't work. It keeps saying it can't log in. I've tried opening it under my network and also when I'm connected to the wifi in my home. What gives? This is ridiculous. I can't see coordinates or the compass because it says the app doesn't know them. Shouldn't have upgraded. Thought things were supposed to get better after an upgrade, not worse. Instead, they should have been honest and called it a downgrade.

	   We like the app however lately it seems the  will get us within 15 feet of the cache before going haywire. After that we are on our own, reading hints and logs to find clues

	   I've been looking for a replacement gecacaching app. I tried this one, and it appears to fall short in two areas using offline caches: First, when I try to display the map and toggle it to not show Found/Owned caches, it still shows them. Second, I can't set it to show only Not Found caches in the List view. You can't see if it's a Found cache unless you open the details display.

	   Worked great for the first hour. Showed all caches, descriptions etc. Then suddenly would only show five caches. The hundreds of others are no longer on the map. In fact the while live map is showing 5, regardless of location. It is set to show ALL Caches. Internet,4G are fine. Other geo apps are working like normal except for this one.

	   The app downloads quickly but fails to install; it just hangs at "installing". It's a great app, I used to use it on my old Xperia, and wish I can use it on my new phone. Finally got the app installed after powering my phone off and start up again. Works beautifully.

	   I have over 1000 finds and nearly all of them were found using c:geo! Droid, DroidX and now my Razr Maxx. Any problems I've had (occasional compass issues) were also problems on the official GC app or were due to my phone... But 1000 finds on c:geo don't lie! Oh... And its free!

	   I love this app and have used it successfully for some time. But lately the compass seems to be all over the place and it makes it near impossible to find anything. This is especially frustrating as I am on vacation and was hoping to search in new locations.

	<title>Fantastic</title>
	<comment>
	   After my iphone packed in, I was forced to try geocaching with an android tablet. Not wanting to pay again for the official app I gave this one a go, after all it is free so there is nothing lost. After a bit of getting used to where all the things where (more to getting used to an android than a fault of the app) I was able to find everything. I could only geocache offline so I decided where I wanted to go and stored them all before setting off. I was able to find all the caches, the clues are in code in case you are a hard nut, but with children it is great just to press on the clue and hey presto it unscrambles. Navigating to the caches I generally used the map which worked - the direction the icon faces on the map is a bit hit and miss but it is effective in that it is accurate. Navigating with the compass was also hit and miss as the needle jumped over the place. (samsung note 8) but I used the voice option and put it in my pocket and that seemed to work great. (switching off auto rotate also helps). after installing "gps status" compass app you can navigate straight from cgeo to that app which seems to work better - fantastic idea. Thank you

	   Good app but the compass is off. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note2. I don't rely on this app for the compass, I use another app. This app is used for the descriptions of the geocache and logging.

	   If I'm on the mood to do some geocaching, this lets me know what's around and then it is off to the races. It get all the info I need and a map to see where I need to go. Can't ask for anything else.

	   The only fault I could find was down to a wonky phone. If you have a lot of saved caches that won't delete, clear your phone's cache. 5* :)

	   I was excited to try this app and searched for locations around me after download. It shows my location as the Indian ocean off the coast of Africa. I live in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania. Could not find a way to fix it so I uninstalled it. Disappointed.

	<title>The best Geocache app.....period!!!!</title>
	<comment>
	   This app is sooo much better than the Geocache app for $10. You get way more and it's free. Much easier to use since it uses Google Maps. Plus is you don't like it you are out nothing!!!!!

	   Brilliant app, jealous iPhone users paid for their geocaching app which isn't a patch on this one. Very happy :)

	   Been using it for several years and very pleased with it. I tend to download caches using wifi and then use it offline for caching when out and about.

	   Cashing is a great way to get your butt out of the house and moving. I'm a truck driver and this is great. Have not had any problems with the app. I use the GPS Status app for locating cashes with the radar feature, and it works great. Also am using my Note 3.

	   I have a blast using c:geo! Better than any other app I've seen. IPhone users are always jealous. Would give 5 stars, but recently had problems with live map showing caches. So many ways around this problem that it almost doesn't matter. UPDATE: Raised to 5 stars due to the c:geo teams way of responding to problems, fast and accurately. Thanks guys!

	   One of the best apps I use. Not only does it allow offline caching but with a few setting change I can import pocket queries and have it create a new list for them. Never had any problems and I keep finding little features the more I use it...

	<comment>
	   Starting to get more and more irritated with this app. The compass doesn't point in the right direction. We log finds..but for some reason this app will drop them and we lose credit for a find. My husband and I have the same phone (Verizon S3's) and our compasses will do different things, especially showing completely different directions. Some caches will show up one minute and disappear the next. There's just soo many bugs. Looking into an alternative app, but hoping you guys fix these issues.

	   I love this app and have used it for years. It is great at what it does, let's you look up caches, navigate and log them. All it needs is to have a stats page for you to be able to check out your own stats and other's...

	   I used to have the $10 geocaching app on my iPhone and loved it. Not feeling like spending another $10, I thought I'd give this one a try. Only issues I see is not being able to log my finds. Or am I missing that. .? Otherwise, this is a very well put together app!

	   Works really well. New phone's gps module gives faster more accurate positions than my standalone gps, so using this app I no longer need to have gps with me. Could maybe be better at managing large lists of caches, but they're available online or from computer anyway.

	   I tried many, this is the most featured app for Geocaching. From planning, to driving to the parking coordinates, and searching the cache, this fulfill all needs. Logging on the spot, trackable management.. huzzah. Way better than the original Groundspeak app. And it's getting better and better.

	<title>A great free Geocaching app</title>
	<comment>
	   When I used to cache with my old iPhone I ran into several cachers who used this app. Now that I live in the Android world I get to enjoy it. Probably my favorite part is that I can message another user straight from the app, which is helpful, say, when asking for a hint or just chatting with another geocacher. This is one of free app that is actually worthy of a 5 star review.

	   Great Features. Sometimes it's not too good about locking it on a cache but that's more a function of the phone than the app.

	   Great app. Would have given 5 stars if the App would no fail so often on sending logs for TB's. Have to log these now manually at home on the PC.

	   I have always been a paper free cacher and have used the official app, but with this one being FREE...you CAN'T BEAT IT! Seriously... the learning curve might be slightly steeper if you're brand new to geocaching but the features are unmatched for a free app! I actually prefer this one to the official app! Thanks!

	   Keep up the good work! the official app can't even begin to compare to c:geo. People need to stop complaining and learn how to use it! come on people, don't knock what is still the best geocaching app around! AND it's free! Trust me, you don't get anything better with the paid app.

	   This app is perfect. It has never let me down (that's not to say I've found all the caches I've searched for, but that's my own fault!) It's interface is user friendly and perfect for what it's designed for. I'd go so far as to say it is probably better than the authentic geocaching app!

	<comment>
	   This is the only tool you will ever need for geocaching. Forget an expensive GPSr or an over-priced, useless app...download this for free and have all the cache details and waypoints you need as well as the logs and a ton of other invaluable stuff with you when you're in the field. Finding that pesky nano that's eluded you for months has never been easier or more fun.

	   I've been using c: geo to geocache for almost two years now. They've made nothing but good developments in that time. It's better and more user friendly than the paid official app. As a 4k find geocacher, this app is HIGHLY recommended.

	   Overall I have no complaints about this app. Love the ability to access multiple geocache databases. Filtering out found caches is also a great feature. If you could log caches (maybe I just missed the button) would make it totally perfect. Thanks for such a great app and for making it free!! Keep up the great work!

	   I use this app more than I use my GPS for finding caches. It's very easy to use and as accurate as my GPS. Keep up the good work C:geo!

	   Fun, easy to use app that helps me locate caches around me even without a plan to look for that day. I liked using the map when I first started out because it is less intimidating than coordinates but I have recently begun to appreciate the compass long./lat. only approach as well. Was Perviously using an android phone with only version 2.3 now with a new phone I hope the experience is even better.

	  Excellent and essential geocaching app. Don't bother with paid for app when this is free and ticks all the boxes ?tYou can rely on this app with both phone and tablet. easy to install offline OSM mapping to save data usage, or when out of network coverage. Surprised by the wealth of features available. Couldn't do without it. Thanks

	   For a free app, this has got to be the most used and best app on my smartphone! Quick to log caches and find ones in the area. Loving the talking compass as I was only just telling hubby it would b great to have that feature to save looking at a screen all time...must save battery! Happy hunting people!

	   App features work great, IMO it does take sometime to learn how to navigate your way through all of the different features but once you know how to navigate through it, it becomes a very strong app for geocaching.

	   Possibly even better than the official geocaching app. Some newer caches dont appear or do appear in the list but dont have compass directions. But thats not the end of the world. BRILLIANT! AND FOR FREE! Keep up the good work.

	   Integrates with GPS Status, which is great. I use this app whenever I am caching, and I have the paid-for official app.

	   This is the best app I have tried for geocaching. I usually have my standalone Garmin gps and bits of paper and pen, but with this great app I just bring my LG E400. The nearby function works quickly even on 3g while out & about. So far I can't find any problems at all. Perfect 5***** for me ...

	   i like this app a lot. especially in connection with send2cgeo its easy to send caches from desktop to my mobile device and store it there. for me a feature is missing where i can monitor my travelbugs without needing to know the code. all in all: very good work, guys!

	   Using it all the time. The big advantage over an ordinary Garmin GPS device is to have the possibility to check the logs as you go. Together with GPS Status Tool it is very reliable. The Browser Plugin makes it really easy to get the needed geocaches onto the device. The possibility to store a sector of the map on the device, like with Google maps, would be nice for when data connection is not available. I do appreciate the quick updates from the community as the project got open sourced.

	<comment>
	   This tool is very complete, and visibly written by geocachers. It allows many ways to collect/store caches, reacts quickly and allows many ways to personalise maps/compass/navigation. I have used the official app as well, and find that c:geo is a lot more professional than the expensive Geocaching app. Only drawback is absence of Pocket Queries. I'll add the 5th star when that functionality is added.

	<comment>
	   If you cache and have an Android phone you'll want this app! Even on my low end $110 phone it works great and it is free. I don;t see how you can beat that. I even like their compass over my handheld GPS. when finding one or two at lunch or after work. I wanted an app anyway to be able to log a find on site at the GC zone and too see in real time what are around without needed to use the website as that is slow and small on my phone. This much better then that and honestly it is better then I though a free app would be for features. Just to not need to bother with pocket query files and upload note files is just great.

	<comment>
	   Wow this app is awesome. Don't ever pay for a geocsching app when you can get cgeo. The coordinates are always accurate and if there not all u have to do is save the cache. You can store caches for offline which is very helpful. You can log your find, a track able, and upload photos. This is the only geocaching app you will ever need. It does everything. You can even scan qr codes and take coordinates. All it needs is a hide a cache section so I can list a cache through cgeo onto geocaching. Com

	   It was working great but updated now caches are not loading on the live map. It used to be crazy fast . Please fix. Previous review.... Great app. A little intimidating at first for a new geocacher but it didn't take long for me to figure out and it is way better than the paid apps and even the groundspeak app.

	   This is the best of the best geocaching apps. Easy to find compass, maps, log book, nearby caches, and events. Never ran into a problem in the three years I have been using it. Awesome upgrades to boot.

	   This is great when you need to double-check anything like co-orcs, clues and descriptions etc as well as doing quick cache-and-dashes if you think you might be near a cache but haven't got your stuff with you. Brilliant!

	   Followed the prompts to go to the website with the access code. Said it wasn't good! ! Can't get past anything to access the app at all further than user name on geocaching.com. No way to actually log in from the app that I can find. Very confusing and not user friendly at this point.

	<comment>
	   For a geocacher who enjoys finding mystery caches, this app is great. Or at least much better than the official app from Groundspeak. Most importantly: Great searching options (find caches from your favorite mystery-supplier), and the option to change the coordinates, so that the cache also shows in its actual spot (well, if you solved the mystery right that is) on the map as well. What I miss is some personal stats, but that's less important than the mystery features to me.

	<comment>
	   I don't like that this type of geocaching is trivial and you have to search several boxes to figure out the whole thing, they turned geocaching into the game of clue. This one wasn't for me...onto the next one

	<title>The one and only no-API alternative</title>
	<comment>
	   I actually do not feel comfortable endorsing this app because it uses web-scraping and not the Groundspeak API to get geocache info. However, the real problem is Groundspeak's own app, which does use their API, is rather limited and has had problems that went unaddressed for months. So I see c:geo as a way of holding Groundspeak's feet to the fire. In other words, until they can make their own app as good as c:geo, don't bother with it. That said, c:geo is remarkably comprehensive for something that doesn't have the advantage of API access. You can browse a live map and search for geocaches by a number of criteria. You can also save caches for later access. You can even log caches from c:geo and drop/discover/retrieve trackables. One downside I can see is it doesn't handle pocket queries as easily as other geocaching apps, but this is a limitation of not going through the API.

	<comment>
	   I've had this app for over a year now, and I have no desire to change to anything else!....... I love the live map - being able to click on a cache & get more info for it. The compass is awesome (when my GPS lets it work properly, lol - it'll jump around a lot, but give it a sec and it usually corrects itself.) I love that I can switch to a satellite version of the map. It's very helpful when my GPS isn't spot on and I can use that to help narrow in on a location........ My only complaint is I can't figure out how to delete waypoints that I've entered. Oh and I have it filtered to take off my finds, and so far it's not removing my recent finds. But not a big deal. Good definitely out weighs the bad!

	<comment>
	   I love this app. I was just getting into geocaching and was not ready to spend money on an app that either may not work as expected, or I found that I really didn't get into geocaching. I found this and downloaded it and found it was great and found my first three caches with it with no problem.. I am now asking myself why I would need a paid app. All the info is synced with geocaching .com. You can find the cache with the compass which tells you how far you have to go and in what direction. Sometimes it may be off a little due to trees. The map selection points you in the direction and can let you know if you are pointing in the right direction and approximately how close you are to finding it.. You can even log your find on you smartphone right where you are as well as check other logs. Trackables can also be logged on your phone. You can also store sites you want to visit as well as add them to a watchlist. You will be emailed when someone visits them. Not sure what the paid apps have over this one. It would be interesting to find out.

	   This is the best free geocaching app I have found. The STATIC MAPS are great for offline use. Add the radar from GPS STATUS & TOOLBOX and you have a winning combination. I'm taking off a star for slightly clumsy UI and small font size (I'm over 50!)

	   I'd like to know how to set my home location so it doesn't say that a geocache is 7700 miles away. Does anyone know how to set this feature? I figured out how to convert it to miles instead of meters. All in all this is a great app and I would recommend it to any geocaching user.

	   I haven't been caching in months/year or two. I decided this morning on my walk I would see if there was anything close by, so I downloaded this app and sure enough, a cache right by where I walk my dog. It lead me right to it, I was able to log it, worked great. It did take me a minute to figure out how to get the different features to work, but was able to figure it out on the fly. Thanks for the nice app.

	   Totally amazing. You guys have the best support in the software business. When a problem is reported, you fix it. Each update, you guys actually improve this app, most software geeks just screw it up. Thank you very much! Keep up the good work.

	<comment>
	   We have been using this app since April with virtually no issues, but since the last update the live map shows every cache as a circle with grey ?? inside. We have to refresh every cache individually to show as a traditional, puzzle, multi, etc and to see if it has a smiley or not. Frustrating because it worked so well before.

	<comment>
	   I'm only starting to do geocaching so I didn't want to pay for the official app. But this one is REALLY good - it lets you do anything to find it. It would be good if there was an option to find all geocaches around you, based on your current location, and show them all on the map! Otherwise, awesome work!

	<comment>
	   I only started geocaching a few weeks ago, but I can't imagine doing it without this app. Access caches from wherever, log finds and trackables, navigation tools, support for offline maps, the app has it all. I can't even imagine printing cache coords out from the site! Couple this with a responsive dev team and the fact that it's free, you cannot beat this. If you don't geocache, download this app, and go. Now.

	   I rarely write reviews. This is by far the best app for geocaching. many more features than the pay app from groundspeak. i know i paid the money to use it and after using cgeo i dont even have it on my phone anymore. Best part, it is free and they are always making it better.

	   I met some folks who geocache often and they recommended this app for my Android Phone. I'm glad that they pointed it out. I have been able to find three caches within the last 15 hours alone. My first three EVER! It's also helped me spot several more that I'll get to soon. This is a top notch app so far. Easy to use, it uses the GPS on my phone accurately, and syncs with your online geocaching profile. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to get into this cool hobby.

	   This app worked awesome, until my last update. Now my pics don't upload, if I touch the screen - it's all over the place, and it's not including my number - on the found caches now. Please fix these and other glitches soon! Otherwise, it's the ONLY device I use for geocaching! Works great and I'd recommend to everyone! Thank you! =) The ONLY thing I HATE about the app, is that it loses my red smiley faces after a certain amount of time. I had a TON of them, no clue where they were; they're gone now

	   Best geocaching app for android. Way easier on the pocket book than the official app, that costs $9.99. Only thing that would make this better in future updates would be to have feet and miles as an option for distances, as I'm a little rusty on converting from the metric system.

	<comment>
	   This is the single most used application on my phone. I've used it at home and abroad, where the 'offline' function helped greatly. It's pretty accurate, and the compass is a great feature, as is the ability to log finds instantly. The most surprising thing is that this fantastic app and its regular updates and bug fixes come without a price tag! Thanks team c:geo :)

	<comment>
	   This is a great app for caching. I am able to store my maps and caches offline and use it when reception is spotty and log my finds as I go, while the memories are still fresh. It did take me a bit to figure a few things out but now its second nature.

	   For a free geocaching app, you can't beat it. Some caches don't show up from time to time, but that's why I have my Garmin. This is great for cache and dashes on the way to work and hiking to boost those smileys.

	   I am relatively new to this game and found this app highly rated on forums and as it was free thought I would give it a go. I have been really impressed. It does everything I need, is easy to understand and operate and is not spoiled by ads like other "free" apps. Well recommended and big thanks to the developers. Team Burgo

	   GREAT app. Only gripe I have is once you have viewed a cache once. Should you view it again the logs are not updated. Therefore if you dnf a cache you cannot see of anyone has found it since you dnf it. Plus, you think you're an Ftf when you might not be . Please fix this cos it would be perfect if you did!!

	   The program does everything I expected it to do and more. I used it this morning for the first time after I was unable to locate to find that I had loaded on my GPS. In no time I was on the hunt and even found and logged the cache using only this app.

	   I've seen and used the official app on the iPhone, and this does the job just as well, if not better. Way points are much simpler. The compass is easier to use. It integrates into other android apps for navigation! Fantastic app, thanks very much.

	<comment>
	   I'm not sure why anyone would purchase a geocaching app when this is free. I had no hesitation in giving it 5 stars. The only way I could seer it being improved would be to add an augmented reality view that gives you a compass and distance reading over the image the camera is taking.

Fantastic features, no issues and it wont crash when you try to navigate. Well done guys...awsome. Uninstalled the rest..this is the best.

	   First time geocacher, and didn't want to invest in a handheld device right off the bat. After using c:geo I'm not sure I want to buy a hand held device. Works great with my Galaxy S3, very accurate. I have only done traditional caches so far, so nothing too hard to find but I feel very confident with the combo. Just need to buy a portable power bank for my S3, may go with a handheld, but this app staying on my phone. Was out to diner with the family and we had some time to burn while we waited on a movie show time. Fired up c:geo found the nearest cache. Driving home with my wife, stopped for a train crossing. Fired up c:geo, was a cache right next to us off the road. I am hooked.

	   The app is very good but when viewing previous logs it is not. We looked at the log for a cache we were looking for, and it said the last log was 8 months ago, but on the pc the last log was only a few days ago. We stopped looking cause of it. Wish it would show all of the logs.

	   Having tried a few other applications to compliment my 62s i find this is easy to whip out, gets a fix quick and locates nearby caches. Used in urban areas mainly to blend in, the options are easy to understand an when set correctly the offline use with fieldnote upload is great. C:geo support also email promptly with a reply on sending ideas in. Cheers guys (an gals) Rob

	<title>Functionally superior in almost every way</title>
	<comment>
	   Groundspeak put out an inferior product, charges an exorbitant amount of money for it, then shuts down any discussion in their forums about competing (and superior) products that do not adhere to their closed API - namely c:geo. Not only that, but they ignore virtually every complaint or suggestion for improvement in said forums. They have my money, so they should be willing to support their user base and provide the product it deserves. Groundspeak could learn much from c:geo's app.

	<comment>
	   I love this app! Only a few tweaks and I would give it 5 stars PLUS!! I would like to have sad faces show up on DNF's. Just like getting the smiley to know I was there and conquered I would like a frowny to known I need to reattempt! Also, I wish that the disabled or archived ones would show up with a red circle around them...so that they are more noticeable and you don't accidentally go to them and waste your time. Other the. That this app is amazing, thank you!!

	   Brings me to the cache every time!! Love it! Only big problem I have is that it keeps brining up caches that I have already found! Very very frustrating, you have to refresh every one you want to go to just to make sure and don't think that will make it go away cuz they keep coming back. And yes I have it set right in settings. No other complaints at all. Have been using this app for years now.

	   Previously I had tried the app with a rooted and modded Evo 4-G, it didn't work well. Understandable since no dev can create an app to work with every customized mod. Now that I've upgraded to a Galaxy S3 I'm thrilled again. The app does what it's intended to do and with my S3 GPS it's pretty darn accurate. Thanks for making an app I can love and make my occasional pastime fun. Beats video games hand down! Previously, Not working with Evo4G At least not since I switched to a CyanogenMod. Worked OK with the OEM system though. Too bad. Great app.

	<title>Best geocaching app out there</title>
	<comment>
	   This is the only one we use anymore cause it's so awsome. Plus I can link the locus free to pop up when I hit the compass button and hold it. This is the only app you will need to seek out caches. Happy caching!

	<comment>
	   I'm changing my previous rant on the app to 4 stars because of the continual updates that keep improving things. For a free app, really works quite well. Once in a while it will still show all caches on the live map, including the ones already found, even though I have chosen to exclude owned and found caches. I can deal with that. Usually only happens when I zoom out past .9 miles and manually scroll beyond my current location. Everything else is very nice. Thank you!

	   My Galaxy s3 works better then my Magellan Trailmate. I had no Idea. It's awesome. But haven't figured out if i can do pocket queries in case I lose network signal, or if I have to store them all individually before I venture out. Either way works for me, just a little more planning that's all. Awesome app!

	   My geocaching GPS took a turn for the worse, so I downlaoded this. And it really is better then the gps. The only thing I don't like (or can't find) is where it tells you how far you are from the cache

	   It's like taking your computer into the field. I love being able to look at newly published caches and log in the field while it's still fresh in my memory. Can't think of anything else is like it to do. Used this app since I started caching a year ago and never regretted it. Hubby jealous as his BlackBerry can't use the ap.

	   Fantastic Ap that has boatloads of great features and all for free. If you've never taken part in geocache finding before then get started. If you're a seasoned pro then try this out for size, you won't be disappointed.

	   As the title says. This app was awesome until it stopped bringing up cache locations on the live map. Android HTC inspire. What happened?

	   Use to be a great app till all the recent updates and now the GPS is so off its impossible to use. Constantly jumps all over can never get to the actual coordinates of the cache. Ruined the app

	   I really like this app. Its great and easy to use and has every feature you could ever want. Before all the updates it used to show me my location and tell me where I was on the login screen. Now it just says unknown location no matter where I am. It's really frustrating please come up with a fix for that. I'm using my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 and then it will be a five star app for sure!

	   I own a Garmin gpsmap 60csx and love it for accuracy. I use c:Geo for locating nearby caches and those quick cache n dashes. Phone (ATRIX 2) isn't as accurate as my handheld however I use it a lot more than my gpsr. I would be lost without it. Thanks for a great app and continuing support on it.

	   The BEST Geocaching app available. I have friends with iPhones that drool at the capabilities of this app which isn't available for iPhone. This app alone is whats making them switch to Android. Yes, this app is THAT GOOD. I will NEVER use anything else. THANK YOU, developers! (Samsung Galaxy S4)

	<title>Map no good</title>
	<comment>
	   The live map is next to useless because of the inaccurate icon placement. [edit to add, after response from c:geo team]. I am a premium member, My map always shows found caches as well as unfound caches. They flood the map (with orange circles) and are inaccurate. They get in the way of the unfound caches. If this is something I am doing wrong I'll amend my rating, but I can't see a way of getting rid of these unwanted icons on my map. Thanks for your reply.

	   I almost paid for the groundspeak app. I'm very happy I tried this first. The GPS + compass feature makes it easy to find caches. I do have one suggestion though, it would be nice to be able to store the caches I'm interested in onto a list I create. I'd like to make the lists so I could choose specific lists depending on where I feel like caching.

	   Despite owning a Garmin GPSr, when on the go I prefer cgeo (possibly since it can hold more) . With the recent google maps update would it be possible to integrate offline mapping? Great app nonetheless The constant flow of updates makes me happy as well as the added functionality.

	<comment>
	   Been using c:geo a while and it is a nice app to use and my favourite of android geo caching apps. In the last version I used there was an issue where even though the list of caches were supposed to be sorted by distance, they never seemed to be. This seems to have been fixed by the last update however sometimes when I use this information and lookup nearby caches the distances aren't show at until you select it and open it up, then go back to the list. If these issues were fixed i'd give it the full 5 stars

	<comment>
	   The live map used to work great but now, with the recent updates, I am missing most of the caches - they just arent there! I go home and check on my computer - voila, they appear - then i load the app - not there....disappointing.

	   The app works great on my Sprint HTC Evo and now on my Samsung Note II. It's nice to be able to see if there are any caches close by no matter where you are.

	   I love this app...only thing i would add is the option to pull up live map if you're using your navigation app for a road trip. That way you can a l8 ways see what's around you. Still 5 stars and best app on the market. Keep up the great work

	<comment>
	   When I go to find a cache I am usually about a mile off. Luckily I go with a friend whose coordinates work on her phone using the app. What can I do to get my coordinates correct so I can find geocaches on my own?

	   Much more you can do with c:geo than the paid for app! C:geo doesn't let you down! If I'd have used this when I first started caching I would have never paid for the other app! This is so much better!

	   Works great on galaxy note. I use it with offline cycle map and saved cache data so i can turn off mobile data. Saves a lot of battery power when out in the sticks! Ability to save all caches in an area and 'drop all' stored data would be great but works well as it is so no complaints.

	   Doesn't load all caches. There are 3 caches missing which are all within 2 mins of my location. Other apps show them ok. Makes it unreliable as it can't be trusted. *** Response to Developer ***: yes i'm logged in and yes my connection is stable (wifi). The app simply fails to load ALL caches, A few other reviewers also state this same issue. I have no such problem using another app available on play.

	   I absolutely love this program and I brag about it all the time... Sadly though the compass has been reeeeeallllly messing up.. I'm in clear weather, strong cell reception and while I'm headed to the cache it will suddenly change course on me. Thankfully I go with GPS and cell phone so the gps keeps me on track while the compass would have me walking in circles yards away from my goal... Is there a suggestion to fix this? An update? Delete and reinstall? Pleeeease help!

	   I used to have this app on my android phone and then I got an iPhone when I got it I was hoping I could find it on the App Store so I could still use the app just on a different device unfortunately that's not the case there are any really good geo caching apps on iOS . Please find a way to put this on the iOS devices so I can still use it and enjoy geocaching!!

	    for free. But it only sorts nearby caches into a random order, no matter if you ask for distance order, alphabetical, or whatever, you still get the same random order however you ask it!

	   Works really well for offline use. I use a small tablet that doesn't have 3G or 4G, so the static maps are really helpful. Can't beat it for free!

	   I love the app except for 1 thing, it doesn't load all the caches in the area, even ones I've seen before don't always show up, so really I don't know if I'm seeing all of the caches or just some, but judging by the number at the top of the screen (2/36) I'm guessing I'm missing a lot

	   C:geo is amazing. Before I downloaded it, I had an expensive handheld GPSr unit for geocaching, and I was very good with it. Now my kids use the GPSr, and I use my phone with C:geo. C:geo is better and less hassle. My favorite features: The live map. It is a fully-functional google or open street map (your choice). It instantly shows all of the geocaches in your area whether you are a premium geocaching member or not! No more pocket queries! Of course, this only works when you have cell coverage, BUT. . . You can also store caches for offline use, and it's THIS EASY: While you are still in a cell coverage (or wifi coverage) area, look at the place on the map where you want to geocache even though it may be out of cell coverage. Tap "menu" and "store for offline," and all of those caches will download to your device! You can also download PQs if you still want to go that route. What about puzzle or multi caches where you need to enter a new coordinate or projection? It's easier on C:geo than on a dedicated GPSr, and C:geo will also give you the option of moving the icon for that cache to your new coordinate on the live map. To know C:geo is to love it.

Then I wanted to post a picture as part of my log and could not. The geocacher website has an icon which on a smartphone is impossible to read . Then today the update added this feature to the APP! WELL THIS IS NOW EVERYTHING YOU NEED IN ONE PLACE! 5Stars Well done and keep on caching. (Is there support for listing a cache/trackable

	   I love this app. Best geocache app I have used. I have not used Groundspeak's because of the price but from what I have seen this is better. My only suggestion would be to incorporate some additional functionality like the app "Precision GPS" to get more accurate location data. Otherwise this is one of the best apps I have used for anything!

	   But the compass is rubbish, it's way off with accuracy and points in the wrong direction every time I use it. To find a cache I must use my Win7 phone, which is accurate to 3 feet. Maybe it's my phone? SG1, who knows Update: will install GPS Status, as recommended by the developer. Review will be updated accordingly. Thanks to the developer for the info.

	   I'm very surprised to see many low star ratings for this excellent app. Well integrated to the geocaching website so downloading caches is easy (58 downloaded in a few minutes this weekend). The compass is easy to use and directs you straight to the cache. It is also very easy to log while you are caching.

	   I have loved this app the last year of using it, however one of the updates has taken away my ability to bulk save caches from the map or nearby list. It appears I can only save individual caches. Very disappointing as I can no longer refresh my stored caches or download a list of new ones when off to a new location. My partner still can on his HTC Sensation having the extra three dots menu button. Please put this button back into the screens for us phones without that button and then it'll be 5 stars!

	   This is honestly the best geocaching app I have seen so far. A few members of my family have purchased the official Geocaching app, but even that pales in comparsion to c:geo. And it being free make it just that much better. It is accurate, fast, ergonamic and easy to use. My only problem might be that the "nearby" tab takes a long time to load, so I just normally use the live map. Regardless, I HIGHLY reccomend this app.

	   Love the program and didn't have to waste $10 on something that does the same thing. Thanks you all for making the game field playable when the handheld isn't with us. Like the logging feature as well.

	   I added the app on my phone thinking I could use it for geocaching. It was a let-down. If I relied on the compass used, I would end up in Timbuktu. But I will use it for cache description etc but that is it.

	<title>Live Map crashes</title>
	<comment>
	   Live Map causes the app to crash on my ASUS tablet. [update] Works fine on my HTC phone. [update 2] The compass seems slow to reorient itself, if at all. Even though I was walking towards the cache, the compass was pointing in a completely different direction. I had to use the decreasing distance rather than the compass to find the cache. [update 3] After a couple of updates on my ASUS table and still experiencing the crash, I went to the app list and emptied the cache for this app, and forced a stop. Now the Live Map works.

	   this app gives new Geocachers the chance to check out what's been cached in your area, links you to all the relevant information and has various useful features to aid your quest for fun. it may not be super fast (unless that's just 'cos my reception isn't great out in the country) and it doesn't always work. nor is it the most intuitive app ever. but hey...it's completely free, and i've used it successfully to find treasure, which is all anyone can ask really!

	<comment>
	   The cache storage feature is the best. Since I don't have a smartphone (Nexus 7), I can go geocaching and have all the coordinates for all the nearby caches stored on my device. It makes it really easy to go geocaching, because you don't have to record the coordinates of the ones you want.

	   Every once in a while, the coordinates and live compass are way off. Sometimes it doesn't load all locations in Live map, or takes a long time. Otherwise, it works amazingly well 92% of the time. Also, it's free...can't beat that.

	   Having the access to geocache pretty much anywhere at the spur of the moment is great. I still use my GPSr if I am out of the city or somewhere that coverage isn't as strong, but otherwise it's an awesome app. Best part, it's free. I think the support is great and haven't had any issues except for when I am in a bad service area and to me, that's more of coverage and phone vs. application issue. If I could give 6 stars, I would!

	   Perfect for when I in a free moment quickly want to go and find a cache. Also abroad where I can use maps and a pocket query on my phone, thus avoiding roaming!

	   Great features, but it parses the ridiculously slow website, which can easily lead to hanging and timeout issues. Should probably go for local caching to ameliorate the problem.

	   All you ever need for geocaching, only loading of caches on live maps is a little slow. For a free app definitly no problem.

	<comment>
	   Love this app - best geocaching app ever This is by far the best geocaching app I've ever used and have tried all of them for Android and some for other platforms. Non-Android cachers are jealous and I've even had some geocaching friends consider getting an older used Android phone with no plan just to use for c:geo. Thanks to the team that picked up it when the original author stopped development and open sourced it.

	   Brilliant geocaching app. The offline maps are a great feature and finding and logging caches is easy. My only request would be a way to cache opencyclemap tiles indefinitely so you can use them offline too as I can't work out how to get these as an offline map.

	   This app is GREAT for caching on the fly! When ever the kids and I find our selves with a few free minutes it's easy to pull up a map and seek out a cache. The map pans so you can even look ahead on your route to see what caches are ahead. This is something you pay a premium for on geocaching.com. Again, GREAT app!! TFTapp!!!

	<comment>
	   After starting geocaching with a traditional GPSr, I was delighted of all the functionality given via c:geo. Being additionally so easy to use, I didn't touch my old device ever since. I use mainly the live-map online, as I'm too lazy to transfer cache data - also I never know when and where I have time for geocaching. If now it would be possible to avoid automatic map rotation (nasty while jogging) without globally disabling display rotation, the app would be perfect.

	   We have just come back from our first geocache! What a brill idea. We got rained on and covered in mud, but had incredible fun ... A 4 hour walk seemed like no time at all apart from tired legs. This app is great, even worked well with no wireless connection. Great idea which makes a basic walk an interesting treasure trail.

	   I rarely use my handheld GPS anymore. This app works great, even when I'm traveling I can get the ones near by when I make a stop. If I'm in unfamiliar territory I just click on the map and do turn by turn directions and gets me close by without and hassle. Highly recommend this app and its free.

	   I have been using this app on 3 different devices including a Motorola milestone, LG l7, and now a Samsung GS2 HD LTE. Very few errors or glitches but works best on a device with good GPS hardware. By far the more superior app over the official geacaching app. Thanks for the solid development efforts!

	   Best Geocaching App we have found so far and its FREE! No need to spend $10 for Groundspeak's app at this point unless they add some amazing new features as c:geo has all we need right there, & did I mention FREE!?!!?

	   Live map was the main reason for having this app. Even with the new update today it says from now on just use nearby. This was the best app, now time to s-can it and spend money on one.

	<comment>
	   I felt I had to update this from 4 to 5 stars. The crew who are spending their own free time updating, fixing and doing everything else for this app w/o monetary compensation are just kicking major butt. This is by far the best Geocaching App out there bar none. I've put in a few suggestions over time for improvement and most have been implemented. I've been pulling the nightly builds to get the latest and greatest and would recommend to anyone to do this. I've found many features that I didn't expect hidden in the tool, making it extremely flexible such as displaying only the caches you've loaded into your stored list (via GPX or simply storing when viewing a cache) within Live Map (when in live map, simply go to menu -> disable live) and it stops pulling data and only pulls caches in you GPX files - great data saver. Awesome use of OSM Maps, recently nighly build is making these even easier to select and use.

	<comment>
	   This program makes it easier to decide to just pick up and go geocaching. The GPS on my phone occasionally erratic, but that is a hardware issue. The chief issue that I have with this app is the filtering options. When I am looking for nearby caches, I want to filter my found caches out. There really is not a good reason for me to want to see only found caches. Change the filter options to remove caches with particular attributes instead of including and this would be five star worthy.

	<title>More than geo caching too</title>
	<comment>
	   On my LG Optimus V, I use this app as a geo cache finder but it has another feature for this phone! I'm not sure if its the same for other phones, but I can use my phone as a USB jumpdrive with downloading files! I have dial up so this is a very very VERY fast way to get updates and files on my computer!!! I love this app soooo much!!!!!

	   For a free app i find this the best for all round use. However i have found that when on location with good signal it will selectively download caches. I placed my first cache thinking it was not near others when it actually was and now i need to move it.

	<comment>
	   The only and I mean only negative is that you cant tell the difference a regular and premium only cache. That only matters to me because my friend cant log them when we go out. Everything else is excellent. The support of external gps is great and it is real quick to look up a cache on street view or however you like!

	   I like the fact that I can be anywhere and open my phone and find a nearby cache. The only thing I don't like about it is it only shows me caches in a certain area around you. It isn't a preside radius so you look at the map and to the west is lit up with caches but just to the east of your location... nothing. If it will show all the caches on the map it would be great. To add pics would be great too. But hey it's free people. Think of all the time you save with this app.

	   This app doesn't do anything. It just tells you to search for another app that I haven't found. Anyway, just a waste of time to install this. The dev should update the what's new section.

	   Been caching for a year and like the sport a lot. I have to been tempted many times to download Groundspeaks software for $10 but then found this app. Works great! The compass gets you there, Interfaces well with geocaching website etc. Free, what more could you ask? I have found more caches, and saved more paper, with this app than anything else. Must have free app for cachers!

	<comment>
	   I've been geocaching for almost 10 years now (on and off), and have used at least three different GPS's and various cellphones. I just recently switched to an Android system and gave this app a try. I find it quite impressive, though I have to say that its biggest downfall is that it doesn't consistently show all the caches in the area. I geocached with two other people using different devices and theirs clearly had a lot more caches shown on their maps. Please fix! Would love to continue using this app!

	   Great overall app but have had consistent issues for over a year now. Nearby never loads any caches and the live map is slow to load everything, and I hate that it has to reload when panning. Have recently had a ton of ?? caches appear and disappear frequently too. Found a consistent bug when on the live map and I choose show as list. Fc's every time. Great free app though! Have had plenty of good times!

	   The application is useless! It has a build-in feature that introduces random error into cache location to make you pay for it. This is proudly explained at developer's website in the FAQ section. So, good luck in finding!

	   Just started with geocaching and I'm quite satisfied with c:geo! I use it with Locus Pro, which provides offline maps. I pick a cache in c:geo, read the description etc. and then click a button to view the GPS "radar" and maps from Locus Pro. Works great together! C:geo seems very clever, with possibilities to use external tools as well.

	   Just wish you'd fix the live map bug so it would hide all your found caches instead of displaying a thousand gray little question marks, or simply labeling everything as a puzzle cache. Really annoying when trying to narrow down what's left in your area to track down.

	   Useful with plenty of settings. But: 1) Crashes always when clicking "show as list" from Nearby map view. 2) Often needs restart for live map to update/to show geocaches. 3) List view's "sort by distance" doesn't sort list correctly. Otherwise good app, thanks for your hard work!

	   Some caches on the geocache website don't show up on the live map and vice versa. Otherwise great app that more than replaces the $10 GC app. Also good function of being able to input coordinates and have the map navigate you there.

	   took me a while to get the offline osm maps to work. found out the hard way that the Missouri.map on the ftp site was a dud. once I found a real one was up and running offline. hint look up vectormaps4locus on Google. Would it be possible to have an option of where to store the database. My external sd is /mnt/extSdCard/

	   Great app but it seems to drain the battery even when not running. Installed this on both mine (galaxy s2) and my wife (galaxy s1) and both batteries started draining very badly. Took off both phones and battery life back to normal. Pity as it is a great app.

	   This app is the perfect way to geocache. It even exports to your sat nav app if you're driving there. Being able to log finds on the spot is a real bonus and the navigation tools are great. I use this all the time if I find myself somewhere with some time to kill. Well worth the download.

	<title>#1 Best GeoChaching App !!!!</title>
	<comment>
	   Have been using c:geo sense my very 1st cache find 2 years ago. I will admit, I have downloaded and tried other apps on the market; But have always returned to c:geo as it has always worked the best & is the most user friendly. Love that I can log my find on the app while still out near the cache, and don't have to try and remember to do it when I get back. I travel a lot for business/work and try to find a cache in ever new area I go, filtering the map to show only cache I've found shows me all the places/areas/states I have been during my travels...

	   Went caching with this alp a few times, to realize that my friends with the Groundspeak iPhone app were finding more caches and unless I manually entered the gc code, they didn't come up. Caching yesterday only ended up finding 3 out of 6/7 that were actually in the area.

	   I'm new to android so thought I'd try the free app first and glad I did! Works well with only minor glitches. There's no player profile area though so you have to go to mainwebsite to keep score tally etc! I see no point paying for an app thanks cgeo!!

	   Works better than my friend's official geocaching app on his iphone. He even had a supplementary GPS device.. C:geo takes me right to the cache 75% of the time.

	   Made the big mistake of paying for the groundspeak geocaching app...which it useless beyond belief for a pay app. C:geo does SO much more, does it better and much faster. This WORKS.

	   Low resource use. Nearby is a good feature. The ability to store offline is perfect for mountain trips with the ATVs. Recommends: have a way to categorize stored caches, and an automatic refresh for stored caches

	   I am disappointed with this app overall. I read some good reviews on it and decided to give it a go. In theory, the layout and the features are very good, but in practice it is painfully slow. It force closes all the time and always seems to freeze when you need it most. Very, very infuriating.

	   I love this app. Never had it crash yet. Only problem is i see caches in an area but when i finally get the time to go look for them, the map doesn't show them. As soon as i get home or pack my bike up to leave. The caches show themselves.

	   Seems to crash a lot. A lot. I've never exited the app manually since I downloaded it. The new update has made things run a little faster, though it now crashes even more regularly. My HTC runs everything else perfectly, so I can't reach any other conclusion than that this app is very, very broken.

	   I've used this app for the longest and it is better than the one my husband uses on his iPhone. Only one problem...he logs all our finds from his phone, but I have to uninstall and reinstall the app to get smiley faces on the ones we've located. It used to show up immediately, but not anymore. I wish this could be corrected. Will continue to use though.

	   This app is simply junk and does not filter out my finds or hidden caches even though the filter is properly set. I even uninstalled and reinstalled the app with the same disappointing results. As a result, the live map is almost useless.

	   I like this app because it works great when you have no data access. Load up your pocket queries and download a vector map of your area from open street maps and your good to go.

	   This is hands down the best geocaching app I have used. So much easier then pc apps that you have to transfer files to/from your gps with lack luster features. This has it all right at your finger tips.

	   Especially on android, as we can use google maps instead of the utter "chocolate teapot" maps used on the website. Although too often the gps or compass can be unresponsive, I cant help but think its not the app playing up, but my phone. HIGHLY recommend this above all others!

	   Keeps force closing on my HTC Desire but despite this I find the app to be very good when it works. I've held back a star based on that fault so hopefully an update will sort that our for me.

	   Droid X. . . Had worked okay, but the live maps located me a few miles away from my actual location. It has great interface. Ease of use is medium, but easier after I went to website & read tutorial. Now program force closes. Hope bug gets fixed soon. . .

	<title>Very nice application for Geocaching.</title>
	<comment>
	   I remember the fist caches that I found. You must bring with you the GPS planning the search in advance. However, thanks to applications like this, you can decide to search a cache any time, anywhere. Highly recommended. The only problem with this application is the speed to find near caches. The access to the information is very slow. It is much better the official application. So, meanwhile this is not fixed, I change my score to 4 stars and begin to use the official app.

	   This us a remarkably extensive app that is an essential toll for any geocacher. It must have taken many man days to code and makes geocaching a real pleasure. Being able to easily search for caches, find them easily and then log then on the go is great. Thanks for the app.

	<title>GPS/compass issue</title>
	<comment>
	   Very stable on HTC One S (wasn't on my old Desire) but when navigating the GPS or compass option doesn't change in bottom right hand corner, just says GPS all the time even if compass is selected.

	   I went geocaching for the first time yesterday and this app works great. Found 4 out of the 6 caches I looked for! Even found a couple caches while on the go. I have an older droid X and it was still incredibly accurate.

	<title>Best Free App but still has issues!!</title>
	<comment>
	   App works very well for geocacheing. The compass can be pretty off at times but with the install of GPS status, I prefer that compass a lot more. It can also be launched from the cgeo map screen, which is really convenient. Another obvious issue is that not all caches load all the time when using Live Map. You know they are there but they sometimes don't show up. My main issue with the app is that logs posted on the actual website may or may not show up on the apps log screen.

	   I have been in contact with Groundspeak since we lost the capabilities OK this awesome app. They managed to get there heads out and give premium geocache users Google maps access. I don't know if my weekly emails helped but I am happy to use this app to its full extent again! Thank you for such an awesome app.

	   Its good for storing the cache info, but you could probably make it user-friendly like on the GPS/compass because my son and I like geocaching and thiss app is the cheapest one :P

	   I really like this app, you can prestore caches for places that have no internet access. Lots of great features. Can do Feet/Miles units now. Paperless caching, wherever you find yourself!

	   Some caches not even showing up. Others are up to a half mile off. My son was using a Geomate Jr and my wife was using app on her Android phone. both were able to locate cache while mine was sending me 1/2 mile away.

	   When I first downloaded this this app, it worked great. Lately though, when loading nearby caches, it won't arrange them in distance, completely misses the fact that some caches exist (despite being able to get them via the wap mobile site) and I've noticed that the 3 I put out a couple days ago don't show up at all.

	   This app is great. The option to save for offline use is great and has helped me many times. There is a lot you can do with this app, but the navigation screen takes forever to lock to your location, and often hangs up. Best to use a dedicated GPS receiver to get you to your destination.

	   I love geocaching but I've had trouble with some of the gps systems my dad and brother have used. This app makes it incredibly easy to go out and have fun without having to struggle with the technology! I love being able to log a find out in the field from the app itself! Awesome app! Thanks so much!

	   Downloaded this before heading out with 11 year old niece for a day of geocaching. She used the GPS, I used my phone. Very impressed with this app. Works great. No need to print information on a cache... this app pulls all the information and displays it on your phone. GREAT!!!!

	   I don't know about this app. At first, I loved it, but now I find the GUI is too confusing at times, and almost always I am led the the wrong area for a cache. In fact, when compared to other apps, this one's map shows caches in the completely wring areas. But the maps are right! So I am not using it anymore.

	<comment>
	   Up until now, I've been using the official Geocaching app on my iPod Touch. I recently got an Android phone and thought I'd try this app, before laying down more money for the official app. I tried it geocaching, for the first time today and was satisfied.. I was able to download and save the caches I wanted, before heading out. I was then able to read the cached description and logs while searching and finally I could log my visit. This is all I really need it to do, and it seems to do it fine. For my needs, it seems a fine replacement for the official app.

	<title>Best geo app</title>
	<comment>
	   This is the best geocaching app. It is kinda slow but I would rather have alittle slow then having to pay to geocache. Thank you so much for making this app I would never try another app after how many I tried before this one.

	   Most if not all problems come from Groundspeak who are constantly trying to break the app. They want to sell premium memberships and this is the only app that gives a similar functionality for free by pulling the data from the website and processing it. Thank them for the huge amount of work and fast updates or stfu.

	   Before this was open source, there was a radar functionality that is no longer there. I don't know if the radar was native or of it was an add on, but it was the reason I used c:geo. Please bring it back.

	   Why did you take away live map, it made looking for caches so much easier. The nearby function does not work on my HTC phone. Go back to the way it was before this update.

	   When do you anticipate OSM:Offline support for current version of map-files since there are only 2 states in the US with 0.2.4 version maps, and I don't live in either -- or, is there a way of creating US-State maps in version 0.2.4??

	<comment>
	   This is the best geocaching app I've tried. I've been using it for quite a while now and am very pleased with it. The accuracy of the compass is great and the convenience of being able to log your find is a must. Only problem is that it takes a while to load. This is great when I'm without my Garmin GPS.

	<title>Great geocaching app!</title>
	<comment>
	   I never write reviews, this is my first! But I had to rate this because of how much I use it and 'love' it! It has so many things I like to use. Easy to navigate through the app. I just realized that you can log you visit on site my hitting menu when viewing the Logbook. Love the detail of the maps. Much better than the geocaching web page. When there have been issues with the app, fixes where done via updates. I email the app developer and got a response, and the app was updated. Only app for me for GC.

	   but I have not been able to download a cache to it all day I keep getting the message "failed to download cache details." Can someone please tell me what is wrong it worked just fine yesterday? I am doing some research and it looks as if they know of issues so my review will be re-rated after all is fixed.

	   Installed first time and it would not download cache details no matter how many times I logged into my GC account successfully. Everything else seemed good including live map. Uninstalled and tried again and it works. Now all features are working, but takes a while to sort new caches according to distance, but I can live with that. Happy now :-)

	   Wouldn't cache without this app! I use it in addition to my GPSr so that if I get stumped, I can look at logs and hints. Also makes it very easy to cache without having to pre-plan a trip. My phone's navigator works right from each cache page to get me where I am going quick :) I love it!

	   The last few versions (including the current one) have been hanging/force closing when Live Map is selected. Changing from Google: Map to OSM: Mapnik in the Settings seemed to resolve this for me. Changing back to Google: Map afterwards worked again too, seemingly clearing the problem. HTH but YMMV.

	   I have always loved this app. Use it all the time and talk it up to all my smartphone cachers. Yesterday this worked great, would be 5 stars, but now it doesn't work. Distance in nearby is still wrong, won't refresh caches, and now I can't even load new ones.  soon!!!

	   tried it a couple times. the free version for the iPhone is better. the compass sucked. ALL the hints are a bunch of random letters like Gbb rnfl sbe n uvag (actual hint from a cache), thought maybe they were some sort of code but i found the same cache from the iphone version and it read perfect where as the andriod version make no sense. on a good note for a free version you can read comments, it gives you a few options but still not worth it.

	   Used this today for the first time. It works great once I got the hang of it, and you cant beat free. It put us on the cache we were looking for easily within five ft. We found nine today. Cant wait to use it again! Thanks.

	   Running this on acer iconia a501 and a Samsung Galaxy S II. Both work just fine, but the live view on both of them tend to come up with out of place caches as will as cages that I already gotten. Back out and start again and it usually works fine for a while.

	   I love this app, but it never loads nearby caches for me that my friends are able to view. Even if I'm at home using my WiFi I can't see them and it makes it really hard to even use the app. When I find them it works great except for the compass being a little off.

	   This app introduced me to my new hobby, it is what the official should be like. Livemap adds to the usefulness and the fact that,it resists GS's continued attempts at messing it up is even better. Would happily pay for thus!

	<title>Best Geocaching App</title>
	<comment>
	   I use this exclusively for all my geocaching needs. Have used it for a couple years now, and it is a fantastic tool. Love that it is constantly being updated to keep it running even when the geocaching website keeps trying to put it out of commission. Also love the live maps and store features. They make geocaching a breeze! This is definitely the best geocaching app there is.

	   I've been using this app off and on for almost 2 years. Blows the $10 OFFICIAL app I bought out of the water. Uninstalled official and use this exclusively now. Anyone got a radar program that ties in though? I used to have one but lost it in a hard reset.

	   It's good that Groundspeak added the map back as I am not going to pay for the other map! Why did Groundspeak make a pay app? Yes because they want us to pay for the thing! But overall KEEP THIS APP!

	   I just finished 30-caches-long hunt and have to say, that this tool is the best what we can wish for - Live Gmap and simple "pocket query" download (complete caches with long description, log list, wpts, pictures). What I love the most is great integration to and cooperation with map app Locus Pro, that has possibility to download maps offline from many sources, and does great work at navigating too. Thanks guys, donation is on the way! :)

	<comment>
	   Only problem I have is that you can't store your own waypoints or enter in manual co-ordinates (or at least I can't find a way...?) a bit problematic for multi/puzzle caches etc. but for straightforward traditional caches it's absolutely brilliant. Still giving it 5 stars, as for a free app it's still fantastic.

	   This is my first time geocaching with a smartphone. I the app did everything I wanted. I could search for and filter caches booth nearby and at another location. I had it give me turn-by-turn driving directions, then switched to map view after I parked. Not all the functions are obvious. If you don't find the function you want, check the menu. It was nearly as accurate as my hiking GPS and a lot easier to use.

	<title>Changes how I geocache</title>
	<comment>
	   I have a GPSr and also an Android phone. I'm finding that I use my GPSr for puzzle caches, or caches where I've taken notes and generated resulting GPX files using GSAK. Where c:geo shines is when I'm in an area without my GPSr or for caches that haven't yet made it through the Pocket Query>GSAK>GPSr process I've set up. I find my GPSr to be more accurate than the GPS in my phone, but for quick logging c:geo is awesome. I have a number of trackables that I carry around with me and I love the fact that I can set things up with c:geo by default so they are "dipped" into the caches I log without me having to do an extra step. I've very happy with c:geo!

	   Took a while to figure it that only locally saved caches would appear on the live map. But worked wonderfully after that. Would be great if live map showed all caches nearby.

	<comment>
	   I'm new to geocaching and this was a great alternative to paying $10 for the official app. I think its great especially paired with send2c:go. Makes storing caches easy I'm excited to use this more

	   This used to be a great app till you lost the live maps. Not very useful anymore. I don't want to store caches in order to find them. No live maps = no good.

	<comment>
	   I have been using this app for over a year now. Though it was better before with the auto update live map you can still almost achieve the same results when you store caches offline. I have over 150 caches stored on my phone and in turn on my live map. You can also send caches from your laptop or desktop browser directly to your phone. This allows you to pick and choose which caches you want to store. I give this app two thumbs up.

	   It is a great app. Just search nearby or by zip code and store the cache and it saves it to the map. I like the filter function that allows to search for trackables. Works great at home and dead on during my recent trip to NYC.

	   You have taken the live map away. The whole purpose of having an app is so you can do things on the go. Im not going to start pressing buttons and running searches while I'm driving so I guess this app is getting uninstalled

	   The last update was absolutely terrible. You took a great past time and ruined it. You do know when you have updates they are supposed to improve your app not destroy it and make everyone hate it. I am going to find a different one. You have made geocaching an absolute painful experience now. Thanks for nothing

	   I used this on my droid to find a cache on my lunch break. I did not use live map, but it does show the location on a map so you know where to start and the easy to use compass can take you from there. It pulled up all nearby caches, and I could easily view details. This is an amazing free app!

	<comment>
	   People need to explore the app a little further before throwing out the low stars. Go to your geocaching account. Figure out what area you need to be in to find caches you want. Then instead of going straight to the live map, use the "NEARBY" icon and find them. They still come up on the map. I've had no problems with this. I still use this app EVERYDAY! =) HAPPY CACHING!

	   People putting one stars for the lack of live map are seriously retarded when it comes to reading comprehension. The application is now hindered because the Geocaching team removed the feature from their servers, not the developers of this application.

	<comment>
	   For all you people who are bashing this app. Go to the Nearby tag. The list will show you the 20 closest caches, if you want more scroll down and hit load more caches, and 20 more will be added to list in order of distance. Once you have your list hit the map icon on top of your list next to the question mark. BAM! All caches will appear on google map and just like the old days we can enjoy a good day of Geocaching. So stop your crying and get out there!!!!!! Love Tom in New Jersey AKA Digitom

	<comment>
	   I agree... This app is very clumsy to navigate without the live app. It's hard to figure out which cache is closest to me, and I can't remember the names of the caches I've plan to find in the future. I used to use it a lot, but I don't anymore. I hope they can fix this soon!

	   I've just done 18 caches and used a map all the way. It's not their fault groundspeak are numpties. This is the best app for geocaching by far. Live view was great and hopefully we will get it back one day but it's still the best app. If you can, store the caches and you will have a map showing the stored caches.

	   Used it yesterday while out and about. Found a list of nearest caches. Navigated to the cache I wanted. Logged as found. Don't blame c:geo for the lack of maps. Direct your anger at Groundspeak. Their maps don't work as they should either. Go check their forums. this IS still the best geocaching app around. And it's free you whiners!

	<comment>
	   Not having a life map function makes it very difficult to see any catches along my travel route. I was looking forward to using this app on my vacation now I'm going to have to look for another app. Bring back the live map function!

	   Use to love the app. After groundspeak made changes to website, live map and nearby functions wont work in cegeo anymore. Was working some till updated cgeo, then both functions stopped. Useless now. Broke down and spent 10 bucks on groundspeak app, but not as good as cgeo was before it went down. If you have older version of cgeo dont update or you lose live map and nearby feature.

	<title>How to live map</title>
	<comment>
	   Don't blame the app because Ground Speak no longer use Google maps. Search for those nearby, when you have a list of caches hit menu and then map and you get a live view. Simple as you like.

	<comment>
	   Although the other functions work well, I use Live Maps all the time by turning it on wherever I am to see what is around. I also use it while driving to see if I am near any. Without it I will geocache much less if at all now. I am going to look for another app.

	<comment>
	   Not sure why people complain about the live map feature. You can still add the cache manually by clicking a button to "store" it and then click on the map. It shows up just as faithfully. It is by no means "worthless". You can still use the map and literally see in what direction and where the cache is. Sometimes I think we are getting to spoiled and lazy. Remember, one time, only a few years back, we had to type in actual gps coordinates and follow little numbers? Actually *think* about what those numbers meant? Ya..

	   This app is the sole reason I started geocaching. I upgraded my phone and had to reinstall this app only to find live map is no longer available. My kids are devastated. We had such fun with this app before and now it is virtually useless. PLEASE bring back live map!

	   The clowns at Groundspeak weren't content charging $10 for a dysfunctional Android app. Now they've decided to try to screw up the caching experience for those of us who enjoy c:geo? Why not devote a little energy toward building a viable app like this instead of ruining the experience for everyone.

	   I know its not the developers fault. But this app is broken. Groundspeak broke it. But i can not justify keeping a 5 star rating on something that dose not work. I will keep a 3 star because you can still use pq to find caches and logging function still works. I hope to one day be able to give app 5 stars again. It was by far the best caching app out there. Until the greedy Groundspeak broke it. Thanks for all the hard work on the application. even broken it is still far better then the official app.

	   I press on the little compass icon and it says that c;geo doesn't know the location of the cache. So what use is that? I've tried it on loads of different caches and its the same. Yes I've got gps turned on. HTC desire. What am I doing wrong?

	   Just open nearby caches (wherever you are) .... load that sucker up with as many as you like...(see bottom of list to hit 'show more caches') then use the map it function (tiny map icon at top or select from items tab) ....bingo all of the caches you called down will be shown on the map...(not just 'stored' ones) the only feature really missing is the ability to populate the map on the fly. Hey I miss it too....but really...this is a free app. Nobody at Cgeo is happy about the situation.

	   When did people forget how to read information? The problem is not c:geos fault. Yes losing live maps is a bummer, hopefully a workaround can be found, until then try a little forward planning, I spent 10 mins using the send to c:geo function on the site and had a very successful caching day. Stop moaning about something that is out of the developers hands and be grateful that they continue to put in their time to make a FREE app for you.

	   I don't like the fact the map is non functional anymore. Without the slick integration of the map, I'm back to GPS again. I do realize it isn't c: geo's choice to do so.I'm rating it on the other features.

	   This app is the best. You get everything you need to go find geocaches. I use this app 99% of the time over my gps and web site.

	   Used to love this app up until they updated it to which I can't see caches on the live map only if I stored them. But what if there are new caches what then!?! I just won't be able to know. What if i go to a new place what then??! 5 stars to 1 star.!! I would put 0 stars but its not available..now I have no use for this app! Uninstall! I would pay to bring back the old version!! Please bring it back !

	   This app unfortunately turned for the worse making it less effective to use. The live map will no longer show geocaches in the area only saved ones. It now takes longer to individually search..then look at the map.

	<comment>
	   This is the best free, open-source Geocaching application in existence. Even with the regular changes made by the yokels at GroundSpeak, the developers work tirelessly to keep the app up and running. Thank you, and best luck in getting pass this latest attempt by GS to kill this app. No matter how this turns out, I will never use the GS app.

	   Love the app, but after update can't follow live map to find caches while I travel. Having to find nearby and store gets frustrating. Wish I could still watch for them along my driving route. Please bring that back! Other than that, its my favorite. Thanks.

	<comment>
	   I don't see why everyone is bashing the c:geo folks. It is NOT their fault, Groundspeak dropped Google (the most common map service) because they did not want to pay Google for the usage rights and they did it without any warning. The c:geo creators were as blindsided as the rest of us, give them a chance to try working on a repair code and stop bitching them out for something that is completely beyond their control. It says right on the warning that they are working on it, give them a chance.

	   Even without the live maps (which were broken by Groundspeak, NOT c:geo) this is still the best GC app available for Android. There are a couple of things I would like changed but not enough for me to give it a bad rating.

	   I really like this app for grabbing a quick cache or two. But since the update the caches dont show up on the map. This was actually my favorite feature of this app. I hope they can fix it soon.

	   Loved using this app until two days ago when it stopped bringing up any caches on the maps. Now it is starting to say i am 2-3 miles from where i actually am at. Any help from dev would greatly be appreciated because me and the family rely on this app for our geocaching.

	<comment>
	   The live map has trouble accurately placing the caches sometimes, which is frustrating and can ruin an outing. Otherwise, the opensource version has remained fairly good. I do miss the reliability of the old c:geo.

	  Love this app, done last 12 caches using it. Although obviously can't search when there is no reception. But good to save caches for off line use.

	   This used to work, and I used to use this all the time. Now all it does is lead me in the wrong direction. The compass freezes, the cache locations are extremely inaccurate. Also drains my battery after less than 30 minutes of use, after fully charging my phone.

	<title>The Geocaching App</title>
	<comment>
	   I've tried several and this is hands down the best. A bit of a learning curve, but I am now completely paperless. Do yourself a favor and get this, play with it, read the manual and also get the GCC app. Send2c:geo is also nice to send a cache right to your phone. That is everything you will ever need besides a pen. Don't forget to donate; this deserves it.

	<comment>
	   From making list for offline to logging travel bugs, this app really does do it all. The only thing I can't find how to do is let you place geocaches.

	   I've used this app for almost a year on my Motorola Defy and it works great. It's so good that I hardly ever use my Garmin eTrex Venture HC anymore for geocaching.

	   This is a great app, and by all accounts better than the official one. Can force close sometimes, has issues with live search, and for some reason 'caches near me' takes about 10 years to load up. But for free, it's superb.

	   This app had been brilliant for me and I had been so pleased with it but lately it's crashing a lot (even since the latest update) and loading takes forever, even with 5 bars. As for opening a cache log...argh!!! Please get it working as well as it was as it was brilliant.

	   This is one of the best Geocaching apps I have used (and it's FREE). No problems/bugs, very intuitive, and I love that it gives the ability to stores cache info, logs, etc. for offline use so you don't have to run up your data. Thanks!

	   I've tried several caching apps and this is by far the best. Developers are active and respond quickly with bug fixes when needed. Thanks!

	   Been working great so far! Didn't realise the first few times out that you can change the compass from magnetic to GPS - changing this gave me much greater accuracy! Great app overall.
