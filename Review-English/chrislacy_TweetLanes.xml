	<title>Crashes when attaching images...</title>
	<comment>
	   Finally decided to give this app a proper try and, well, as the title says, it just crashes every time I try to attach an image to a tweet. Looks like it's not been updated for a while either so will likely just try something else.

	   I've been using for a long time and would give it 5 stars but it is no longer working and not getting fixed. Crashes when you select pictures and links in tweets just linking to the tweet they are embedded in. Uninstalling

	   I would give this app 5 stars if it did not freeze up which is quite frequent and if there were a way to block bullies and trolls. They are more prevalent than ever on twitter. This a a much needed feature. Other than these issues it's the best twitter app by far.

	   Force closes when opening a picture with Marshmallow. If it could be fixed I'd definitely stay with this app, however this hasn't received an update for a year and a half now, and seems forgotten. Time to move on I guess, shame, loved this app. UPDATE: Tried the official Twitter app, it's rubbish!! Now using TwitPane and it's really good.

	   I've used this as my twitter client for a long time. Works great, excepting it doesn't really work if you want to see reactions to a tweet for people that you don't follow. That doesn't work. With Android Marshmallow, the non updates to this so really show. If you click on a picture, it crashes. Maybe time to move on

	  Like Tweet Deck. Good customizability. I didn't find an option to make the tab labels into icons. I actually hate the constantly open compose tweet taking up valuable space. Incoming long DM's are shortened into links. This would be almost perfect if those few things changed.

	   You can't mute someone you follow or mute just one person's retweets. This is something I find really useful on Tweetcaster, which I'm not using atm because their link system is messed up after their latest update. If they fix it I'll probably go back but it would only be for these two features.

	  It's quite good, but I had to uninstall. There is simply no ability for longer than 140 tweets. Plume, Tweetcaster, and UberSocial, all work with Twitlonger, but they all have annoying problems. If Tweetlanes simply added Twitlonger support, it'd be heads above others. It's crucial that I have this, so... sorry.

	   Good app but a few small annoyances. It's a bit slow to load tweets however once it has it does load a lot more than other Twitter apps. Also only loads a certain number of tweets and then I have to wait for a while before I can load the rest. If these could be sorted I would rate it a 5.

	   This is probably the smallest twitter client out there, and is amazing! It doesn't have all the clutter that the other apps have. It's very easy to install, login, go. Very nice if you want a simple twitter client without clutter!

	   Good twitter app with all the features you'd want in an app. Like others the only thing keeping it from 5 stars is that the UI is dated, but I still use it on my tablet as my primary twitter app

	   I wasn't impressed with this app at all it took entirely too long for my timeline mentions refreshing my page etc to pop up which makes this app useless to me I have to say this is the worst Twitter app I've tried so far the best I've tried was tweetcaster far as design its perfect an easy to use but it also has its problems but despite its problems it still beats out the rest of them if they ever fix those problems like lagging don't always show RTS etc tweetcaster would be by far the best Twitter app ever

	   So far it's not bad. May rate higher once I've used it more. 2 problems though. It takes quite a while to load after I have swiped to something and not all of my direct messages show up.

	   If you clear the cache often, then images generally load okay, but who wants to do that. Please fix! Otherwise a great app. This image issue became too much of a burden. Had to uninstall it and move on to the next app.

	<comment>
	   The only thing reason I did not give this a five-star rating is because it lacks the ability to organize lanes into the order I'd like to see them. It gets a bit tedious swiping continuously to get to the lane I want. Otherwise, this is an excellent app.

It doesn't seem to accept my password even though I know I am entering it correctly, then it just keeps taking me back to the Twitter login screen. Anyone else experiencing this?

	   It's a nice app, runs smooth, but I hate the bottom bar where you type your tweet, it's too large. I would've liked more if there was a button on the top bar to open the bottom bar or open a window for tweeting.

	   Very handy app, but the rate limits are killing the experience. Post more than 4 or 5 tweets in a couple of minutes and you have to wait up to 10 minutes for your timeline to refresh. No other client app has done this me.

	   But I can't seem to find any Follow button anywhere. I deleted the official Twitter app because this is better and a lot more lighter. I just hope there's a way to see who favorited your tweets. Will give this a five if it has an accompanying widget.

	   Very nice app with good UI except for the bottom tweet bar which stays there and takes screen size. And even bat is thick IMO,could be made a little thinner to provide more screen space. A part from that very smooth scrolling and nice app.

	<comment>
	   I've been using Tweet Lanes for about a month and like the design and what the developer is trying to do. If you just want to use it to look at your timeline, view your profile and your tweets/retweets/mentions then this will work for you. Unfortunately I use lists to manage Twitter, and this app is very inconsistent with this functionality. Sometimes I can go to the settings and see my lists and add them in to the main app. Then the lists disappear from the main app and when I go into settings, they have disappeared from there too, so I can add them back in. This happens daily. I also can't seem to add or manage those lists from the app, so afraid I'm back to my unsupported Falcon Pro app for Twitter for now.

	   Predominantly used tweetdeck for twittter accounts, this could be an awesome alternative/replacement. Slight lag compared to normal twitter app, but I can live with that. How about a dropdown to select a particular lane? Scrolling left and right through 10+ lanes is not practical :(

	   Supposed to refresh every 15 minutes but woke up this afternoon and no new tweets and manual refresh didn't pull up anything either. Falcon pro working just fine so I know it's not Twitter. Also, timeline jumps around after clicking on links and going back. Doesn't seem to remember your place in your timeline.

	   If there is already the feature to mute a user's tweets in this app I apologize, because I wasn't able to find it. If it's not, how about adding it?

	   *This* is what an Android app can/should be. It doesn't try to mimic an iPhone app, with "curved" surfaces and such. It adheres nicely to the design guidelines and produces a beautiful app that is a pleasure to use, and (unlike the competition) a pleasure to read. I absolutely *love* the contextual Tweet bar, and the multi-tweet select. Fantastic. I can wait for the notifications--after searching for days, this is the best Twitter client for Android--period.

	   I did notice that tap and hold yo select tweets doesn't usually work. I have to tap to the individual tweet screen and then retweet or whatever. It's weird that the @Mentions section shows random tweets from people you follow but didn't @ you. I also wish that when you viewed your own profile, it would display like a preview of the web version with the background and headline image. Not a major issue at all though.

	<comment>
	   Looks wise this is really nice, and it's fast and stable. I like the interface - being able to select multiple tweets to reply to is a particularly nice touch! But it desperately needs a few more features. Being able to mute hashtags/users/etc is a MUST, trending topics would be good, adding your own column/lane would be nice. It's close to perfect, honestly, a few more features and this would be a contender for definitive android twitter app.

	<title>Very nice app, still needs some work</title>
	<comment>
	   I like it, lightweight and have most features I need. Though it isn't stable enough, it crashes a lot, and most the times refuses to open embedded images (gives an error message without an option to reload, same image shows well on other twitter apps and web). A feature I used frequently on other apps is posting to facebook by the way (no facebook time lane, I would actually opt to not allow it, just the possibility to _selectevly_ make posts as I tweet)

	   How you could have a twitter app without trends is ridiculous and as for auto complete hashtags you have to scroll down a list over and over if you want to make consecutive post

	   Doesn't allow for two-factor authentication at sign-up for Twitter. Jumps from the authorize screen to the Twitter Web based welcome screen with options to sign-in or sign-up. A few moments later, the SMS notification with the login code arrives on my phone but there is no way to enter it.

	   When I go to see the new tweets in my feed it says on the top "XX New Tweets" which is great! But when I go into my other tabs, and come back to the timeline it says "XX New Tweets" but I have already read those tweets. Also conversations don't always work properly. But still great!

	<comment>
	   All of a sudden a few weeks ago it started to be incredibly slow. Loading new tweets (or replies or direct meggages) for 2 minutes even on wi-fi. And it's not a network problem, got an official client running and it works instantly. Too bad, it had such a nice interface.

	   The app has basically everything I've been looking for. You can do everything the original Twitter app can and you also have columns too, and finally, a third party Twitter app that let's you view who retweeted you. Everything is great, only problem is it's lacking tending topics.

	<comment>
	   I love Tweet Lanes because it does what other twitter clients rarely (or don't) do, such as: can customize how I want my Tweet Lanes would be by customizing columns, easily block or report as spam people in my timeline just by few clicks, see who retweeted a tweet and which my tweets that are retweeted by people. Rated 4 stars because it doesn't have a really important feature: muting people. I will rate 5 stars if you enable this or reply to my feedback email that sent to you :D

	<comment>
	   It's a great app.. I love it. But there are a few features where improvements and bug fixes would help. Chief among them being, when I share something from another app, the tweet gets prepended with the word 'null'. I've seen this with dropbox and feedly. Due to this bug I'm still not using this as my main Twitter app.. hope to return to tweetlanes soon

	   I like it nice clear layout, could do with been able to turn off the blue bar notifying of new tweets as it obscures the new tweet. But otherwise excellent.

	   Still the best interface but ultimately disappointing. No trending, no auto complete on mentions means as a standalone app it's not complete.

	   The only issue I'm having is related to notifications. Every 5min I get a notification even if I don't receive new direct messages or replies. I already unistalled and installed the app but didn't work out, if anything it got worse =( and I don't know how to turn off completely those notifications. But I love the app, it's almost perfect. Maybe we'll have a widget in the future? That would be awesome.

	   But the limit of what you can do make this app terrible to work with. There's no trending topic. Which is a basic essential for twitter. No update is a red flag app for any twitter app.

	<comment>
	   Pretty UI, but how come I get a "Rate limit exceeded" warning just at the time I run the app? That's pretty annoying. If that would be fixed, together with the possibility of muting users, that would make this a really great app. Right now it's completely useless with the "Rate limit exceeded" warning just popping out whenever I run the app. And please, the app icon should be changed. It gives a false impression about the pretty UI.

	   Out of all the twitter clients I've tried this is one of the best. The only thing stopping it from becoming my main twitter client is the low res inline images. All images look a bit blurry so I end up having to visit the mobile twitter site to view then properly. I'm really hoping this can be addressed in the next update. Great work Chris!

	   I'm a Twitter vet but not as rabid a fan as I used to be. I needed quick, full featured and no bloat! I've tried them all and bought several. This app is quick, does all I want and does it well. 3MB including data files for 2 accounts AND show all my replies, RTs and lists! Wow! :-) LOVE it so far, will watch to see if data continues to increase forever (no I don't mean flushable cache). If it doesn't bloat over time I will forget Plume Pro and Seesmic Pro & ONLY use this. I highly recommend TweetLanes.

	   Has the potential to be the best Twitter app. Love how things just work, things that other apps have taken a while to implement. Needs trends and notifications, which I'm sure must be coming. Also the ability to change the ordering of the lanes would be great. Integrating Tweet Lanes into Action Launcher somehow would benefit both apps greatly. Top dev, keep at it.. your hard work is paying off!

	<comment>
	   This was my favorite Twitter app by far, but it's not able to adapt to the latest Twitter API rate limits. Now the rate limit is exceeded immediately on launch, and you're not able to perform any searches, view profiles, open discussions, etc.

	   I've tried every Twitter app. I've tried three betas over the last week. Two are on pace to be good, this one is on pace to be the best. Giving it 5 stars based on the potential. Can't punish a great beta. Just needs notifications to become THE app.

	<comment>
	   Loved the simplicity of tweet lanes when I first tried it. Then the follow button disappeared so I couldn't follow anybody new. Switched to carbon, another great Twitter app. But now that the follow button is back after the latest update, tweet lanes is once again my go-to Twitter app.

	<comment>
	   PRO: Beautiful design, lots of interface/customize options that make it a true pleasure to use. Smooth and mostly lag free. My favorite out of them all - that I cannot use! CONS: No User auto-complete, Follow/Unfollow not working?, No Notifications, No option for longer tweets. This app has the opportunity to be the best for Android; but some key features are needed.

	<comment>
	   Shows me tons of columns (customizable), handles regular & classic retweets, can do multi-select, standard, pretty Android interface. This client works the way I want twitter to work. I look forward to notifications, but no one on Android does notifications well for Twitter so it doesn't really feel like they're missing anyway.

	   TweetLanes was my favourite client because I can read my lists! That feature coped with the lack of other basic ones like notifications or autocomplete. Removing lists is nonsense. I'll have to take a look at the code and see what happened, now that it's been open sourced.

	<title>What happened to the lists?</title>
	<comment>
	   I've always used this app as my twitter client, but after this update I've lost the ability to have lists as one of my columns. Is this option hidden somewhere or removed all together? Either way I'm downgrading back to the old version for now.

	   Easy to get to grips with, settings are clear, understandable and just what a twitter app should have. Love how you can change the theme. I have Holo Dark on my phone and Holo Light on my tablet. Plus, early users get all features for free, forever. So download it now.

	<comment>
	   Chris is a great developer, it's just a shame Twitter is trying to knock out 3rd party clients. Going open source could make this the best Twitter client available. It already was one of the best.

	   Tweet lanes is an amazing app with lot of intuitive and smart features. But maybe you could update it more frequently and add some features like tablet mode, etc. Personally I think that it's the best Twitter client for Android.

	   Sure this was great when it came out. But even then it was missing a lot of features. The settings are thin and there are no notifications. Can't tweet @ someone without memorizing their twitter handle. Its also clear the developer has abandoned this app as he is focused on his launcher now. Its a shame, this was promising but it remains 1 star until it is completed.

	<comment>
	   The layout is nice. Good functions. That's all. Slow to retrieve images, MANY basic features not added, like notifications and the ability to erase tweets. And the developer it's not interested in updating it anymore, so if you install it, it's all you are going to get.

	   I really used to like this application so much. I also tried to encourage everyone I know to try it because what a good features it brought in the beginning. But, later it stops there update & it become an old app. I tried to contact the developer many times through his account in Twitter but everytime he ignored my question & never replay. I advice to try other Twitter client like Falcon Pro or continue using the official app which is much better than this application.

	<comment>
	   This is a great twitter client. however, the updates seem to have stopped, according to the changelog and the reviews. Is this app still being worked on? I also believe notifications should be a staple feature for such a great app. Adding.Facebook/G+/Tumblr post integration would just be icing on an already good cake. :) /Edit/ App has begun to show signs of instability. Keeps kicking me out when I wanna scroll thru tweets! Had to knock off a star for that.

	   Decent twitter client. Just needs the stuff that everyone else is already asking for (notifications, delete tweets, widget, etc.). Get that sorted and it's an easy five star. Too bad it seems that the dev doesn't work on this app anymore. It could have been great.

I will rate 5 only if there's notification, translation, able to delete own tweets and uploading of images. Get it done please! It's a real 5stars app for it with all those mentioned features I given.

	   If you are looking for the best twitter client, search no more. This is it! It's similar to tweetbot on iOS. You get all the great features from pull to refresh, inline images, column views, white/black holo theme background, tap to jump to top, and so much more. Oh and there are no ads in this version. It is simply amazing.

	   I tried this out months ago, it was good and I was looking forward to updates .... But, development has ceased due to the twitter api limit. Way to go twitter, slowly killing off third party apps, the very things that made you as popular as you are today. Shame they can't provide us the app we're all looking for.

	<comment>
	   I was looking for a twitter client with fast push notification for mention and new direct message and I believed I haven't found any that suits my need. So I ended up trying almost every application I can find here on the app store. Tweetlanes couldnt provide me with that as well but when I tried it, I feel happy with the Retweets of Me feature as it has shown me my tweets that haven been retweeted by others for quite a long range of time(line). 4* for the feature :)

	   Finally something good enough to replace Tweak deck, its clean fast and very user friendly! Will you consider implementing a translate feature though?

	<comment>
	   Notifications plus ability to rearrange the lanes and account modifications would make this app better than the rest! theres a few small formatting bits with the lane titles where the full title doesnt appear. Right now its really good for viewing and posting, but not necessarily enough for me to go ahead and uninstall the original twitter app just yet since i still use it to change my profile pic, accepting follower requests, and other mods.

	   Sorry to see that it will loose support soon. This is my favorite twitter app for Jellybean. It follows Google's design guidelines, and is very very stable for a beta. There are some features that could be added, but overall it does everything that I need it to (I'm a very light twitter user). Great job to the developer!

	   This was poised to be the king of Twitter apps when it first began. I was happy being a beta tester, etc. We were always told "Notifications are being worked on! They're next!", but then came his next project, Action Launcher. Unfortunately, Tweet Lanes was put on the back burner and now it's been over 2 months since the last update. Don't get me wrong - I'm very appreciative of the app, even in its current state. I Judy wish it had notifications. Maybe some day. Until then, I'll sick with TweakDeck.

	<comment>
	   To me, this is basically TweetDeck, with better UX, in a Holo theme. Works great. I love that I can display certain lists as columns. Something almost every other app is missing. Lack of notifications isn't a big deal to me, I just use the official Twitter app or Echofon for notifications, but generally dismiss them and open up TweetLanes. It's a pity Twitter's API limits means nobody else can join in on using it, and as a result development may decline.

	   The best twitter app I've had the pleasure of using. The only one to pry Tweetdeck from my phone, even though it hadn't been updated in years. Now, due to Twitter's 100,000 user cap, development has as good as stopped, which is a real shame. Damn you Twitter!

	   TweetLanes was one of the best up-and-coming twitter apps for Android, but it has been months since the developer has mentioned the project. Notifications are the big missing piece, but there are also some bugs, like not being able to share images from the gallery with TweetLanes.

I wish that feature could be made permanent but I'd still love it. A nice clean looking app. Worth a try and you may end up loving it like me.

	   Besides the obvious (no notifications) you also can't delete tweets that you posted using this app. Even when you go to the main Twitter site and delete that post, they still show up on this app. Hopefully the developer makes an update soon.

	<comment>
	   Still my only twitter client, however development has all but halted. Developer has moved on to a new project (one that I think is far less beneficial) and stated he won't update this app until his launcher app is released. There will be several maintenance updates before he returns to tweet lanes, so don't fall in love with this app. I did and I refuse to change, but I am now having a sub par experience.

	<comment>
	   Once I got my ICS on my Bionic I quickly installed this app based on reviews and recommendation from some friends. After trying it out for a week or so, I like it a lot. I would have given a few more stars but the lack of some key features dropped it to 3. Features not in this app I find useful in other twitter clients 1. Notifications 2. Edit Profile 3. Change where you can post vids/pics 4. Add/Modify lists - move ppl around or create new ones Once these are updated, I'm sure this will be a rockstar application.

	<title>Stuttering performance</title>
	<comment>
	   Have been using this client since its early inception and love it for the most part but the recent lack of updates and remaining issues have forced me back to the official twitter client. Performance has just fallen right off with this app, it can no longer scroll without stuttering or even change lanes without a harsh visible delay. 3 stars for original idea but the performance and support just isn't there at the moment. If/when things change I'll be back to this client.

	   Forget touching all those buttons on your other Twitter apps. Watch this app flow through all your different Twitter functions by swiping through all your feeds! While not fully customisable, this is well worth the download (it's free, of course!), the interface is brilliant and really beats all the others out there. Thanks!

	<comment>
	   Okay, so this app is officially a dud for me. Dev doesn't add basic functionality like nick auto complete or notifications and is more interested in running his blog. His philosophy is that beautiful UI is more important than functionality, like the Apple crowd wants. Don't use this stupid app.

	<comment>
	   Some minor UI flaws (in my opinion) keep this from getting 5 stars from me. 1. The "delete all text in the text box" time bomb needs to be removed. It is far to easy to hit when placing a text cursor there. 2. I think that touching a tweet should select, and bring up the contextual icons. I find that these are the actions I perform most, and having to constantly long press to reply our retweet is painful.

	   I love this app, everything about it is absolute class. If you like the Holo themed apps that came along with ICS and JB, this app has it all. The best part, the functionality is simple but so well thought out. Thank you Chris Lacy and Digital Ashes! Once you bring in notifications, this will be complete. :)

	   I really like this app and it's now my daily driver. I love the unique layout. It is fast scrolling and easy to get around. I also appreciate the clean font and themes. I've been a fan of Seesmic fan for years, but am looking for a replacement since Hootsuite recently bought them out. Once Tweet Lanes allows saved searches, notifications, simultaneous posting to multiple accounts, and perhaps posting to facebook - I'll delete my Seesmic app and move over full time. A scheduled tweet function would also be fantastic.

	<comment>
	   I love this app. It is really clean. However, it lacks a mute/zip function to hide tweets of people you follow without unfollowing them. It also lacks a column for trending topics. It would be great if it has a large timeline viewing widget. But overall a very smooth app! :) update: ok I just found some problems when uploading photos. No notifications too! :( please fix, thank you!!

	   Brilliant app reason for for 3 stars is due to when scrolling up or down it is severely choppy which is irritating the choppyness seems to be reduced when you change theme to darkness

	<title>Was 4-stars but now 3. Why? TweetSpotlight</title>
	<comment>
	   The UI is very clean and well thought out. It's the best Twitter client I've found so far for handling Twitter lists. I really enjoyed it when I first tried it out. However I tend to read through my timeline quickly and add articles to Pocket for reading later. In Seesmic, I could just long-press on a link and immediately send to Pocket. With TweetLanes, it took 2 clicks but I could deal. But with the newest update and a new screen called TweetSpotlight, I need to long-press (for what seems like a really long time) in order to see the Share option. And sometimes the long-press doesn't fire and I have to retry. It's irksome and perhaps a deal breaker.

	   Remembering place in the timeline doesn't always work and it never updates for new icons and such. Love the app though... and Chris Lacy is cuute! Let me delete, please. Autocorrect is ruining my tweets and then I have to open up chrome to delete.

	   Great Twitter Client. I speak for a lot of people when I say that this app needs to show new followers and who favorited our tweets. That'll make this app complete. Great Job!!! :) nd themes nd also the new tweet spotlight kinda kills the whole objective of quick reply.. Seemed better when you touch on the tweet nd just reply without having to open the tweet to reply.

	   This app is VERY close to beating Tweakdeck (and Tweetdeck). What holds it back? Custom columns. Absolutely necessary. And an easy way to see which columns have unread tweets. And lists as columns? Only the ones I choose, please. When these things are addressed, I'll gladly pay for this.

	<comment>
	   It's certainly not perfect (it is a work in progress right now, after all...) but it doesn't deserve less than four stars either because the developer is actively working on this and it will be perfect when it's done. There are a few features I'd like to see implemented but I'm sure they will be shortly. Will change my review when this app is complete!

	   It's a beautiful app and it has cool and unique features that other Twitter clients don't have. However, some basic features are missing. It needs more settings, a lot more (esp. refresh and column settings). Notifications are definitely needed. Also, I'd love to have icon headers for the columns. Really looking forward to future official versions.

	<title>WHY CANT DELETE TWEETS OR UPDATE PROFILE</title>
	<comment>
	   Its so annoying not being able to go back and delete your tweets!!! Does this have notifications when people tweet you?!!!!!! Also a big letdown is not being able to change your profile pic or update your about me.

	   User interface is beautiful: finally a proper Android Twitter client that uses Holo Light and Holo Dark themes. My user experience with this app is ten fold that of the stock Twitter app. The context tweet menu is genius as is scrolling via the volume buttons. The only thing this app needs is a the ability to configure the refresh speed but I'm sure the developer is working on that. Seriously great app!

	   Really clean interface, scrolling down timeline with volume buttons is intuitive. This is one of those rare Twitter apps which let's you zoom in on photos! I can't say I'm a huge fan of the icon, just because of its size, but I'll admit the feet/lanes is rather clever. You can attach photos but GPS tagging hasn't yet been added. Also, I've done the 'Free for Life' thing and it said it was successful but now the option has come back? Will I still get the upcoming features?

	   Not only is it functional, it is also beautifully designed. The app gets things done quicker than the Twitter-app by Twitter INC. itself. Way quicker. Also, the developer's interaction with the users through his Twitter-account is simply amazing! It gives you the feeling that your opinion actually matters to him, and he actually listens to what people request the most. I only had to subtract one star, with pain in my heart though, because it is not fully featured. But if you love the Holo-theme and want something that completely differs from any other Twitter-client known to man, you have to try this one. You won't regret it.

Still needs work but then it is still at early stages of development and you should expect that. Download. You'll not regret it.

	   I love the look and feel of the app. I also love that I can quickly swipe to my following list. I can deal with the lack of a widget, but the app needs to at least be able to act as default for twitter links. Add that to the next update and this will be my new daily driver.

	   1.  the "X" in the comment box! If it has to be there, then ask if I want to discard my tweet. 2. Save as Draft needed desperately. 3. NOTIFICATIONS - I have no clue when I'm mentioned or DM'd

	   This is the greatest app I've used next to Plume. Smooth, functional, has a nice clean polished look, and most definitely fit for Ice Cream sandwich but in order to get the 5th star from me, you need push notifications...

	<comment>
	   This is very well designed Twitter app but it's missing two very key features: 1. The ability to auto-populate user names as you begin typing. 2. It only stores Tweets in cache from the last update. So if you use an underground subway or don't have service for part of your commute, you won't be able to ready your full Twitter history, only the Tweets since your last refresh. Add these two features and my 3 stars becomes 5 stars without question.

	   Transitions from Page to Page are smooth and fluent while not all the profile pics load right away (even though I'm on wifi) it's still impressive. Easy to respond to tweets and pull to reload is great! Would like an interactive widget for quick access as long as it has set intervals for when to reload feed (welcome to tiered data) other than that. No complaints and keep up the good work.

	   I downloaded this app as soon as it hit the play store. With every update it improves, bringing new features. The developer churns the updates out at incredible speed and keeps you updated via his Twitter profile (@chrismlacy). If only more developers took as much pride in their work as Chris Lacy. Highly recommended even in its beta state.

	   It's great to finally see a holo-styled Twitter app that works so well. Simple, intuitive and fits in amazingly with the rest of the Android OS. Only 4 stars due to lack of proper tablet support, but would be more than happy to give 5 stars if it appears in an update.

	   Love this app, the layout is easy to navigate and has a clean and clear format. I've been using Plume for a very long time but I will change to this one. Only 1 gripe please can there be an easy way for saving pictures without going to browser then this app will score 5 out of 5 for me. Keep up the good work :)

	   Works great! Misses a few features, but catching up really fast; using as my primary client, with almost no trips to Plume. Would be nice if Twitpic was supported, now it "only" does the built-in Twitter picture hosting.

	   hi I have rated for 4 star because there should have some  to do too. I suggesting to have auto update frequently for some timing. and have some notifications to note that have new tweets pop up.

	   I am very impressed with the layout, speed and simplicity. Maybe this is not the most featured twitter app but the developer is very active in the updates. This became my main twitter app now.

	   It is currently my default Twitter client. Though I have three installed (Boid and official one). I am waiting for it to get notifications. Love the image gallery feature. The latest update with lane selection just fixed my last issue (too many lanes used to drive me crazy!). I do wish for RTing multiple tweet feature.

	<comment>
	   With each new update, Tweet Lanes gets better and better, and as a result comes closer and closer to being my main Twitter app to replace Plume. Literally all I'm waiting for now is Tablet support and notifications. Beautifully follows Android ICS guidelines, and I'm loving the Context Tweet Box and the ability to select multiple accounts for replying/blocking/favoriting. The Holo Dark theme is also very nice and it even blends in with the Gnex's Navbar and bezel. Easily the best Twitter app for ICS phones out there, possibly even the best Twitter app, period.

	   Long time Tweetcaster user. Just started using this app a few days ago after reading a blog review. I reeeaally like it. Love the ui and the smooth ics/jb look of it. A few things missing (especially notification) but I'm gonna stick with it and give the developer some time to improve this already impressive app. Then... 5 stars for sure!

	<title>Great App, But Still Needs Improvements</title>
	<comment>
	   This app shows a lot of promise but there are many areas in which improvement is needed. Scrolling is choppy and when you view a tweet with several links it is hard to click on the one you want. There should be an option to choose the link you want like in Plume or my favorite Twitter client Twicca, which this app reminds me of. On the plus side, this app is beautiful and I love the constant text box at the bottom, which enables quick commenting. I also enjoy the Jellybean look. Profile pages are also beautiful. Please keep up the good work. This is a wonderful app.

	   Hands down the best twitter app. Dev is super responsive to user feedback and even gives his followers early access to beta builds. Performance is still a little clunky even on my Galaxy S3 but other than that this app has no competition. New features being added all the time and the developer does a great job of keeping users up to date on current progress and what's coming in the next release.

	   keep me from giving this higher. I would love to see FB integration, but that's not the deal breaker. The deal breaker is the lack of notifications. I keep my Twitter app on all the time and it notifies me of my DMs and mentions. I like having a notification so I don't have to think about checking it. I know if it tweets that's what I've got waiting on me. I'll keep it for now. But I don't see it being my daily driver YET...

	   I have used them all, and this is the best, most stable client out there. The pure Holo theme is great, and I have not looked back! Sure there are missing features, but it has only been out for 2 month max! The rate that it is being updated with features is amazing!

	    twitter app. The reason i only gives it 4 stars is becouse it misses a few futures like Zoom on picures, the ability to see what persons other are following,notifications and some more. But besides that it is a fantastic app.Edit. I am almost ready to give this app 5 stars, but i still miss one future: The ability to see Who many and Who has retweeted a tweet.

	   Awesome app it's come along way, so smooth and fast, and it has plenty room to grow! Please add ability to delete tweets, if you can now, I can't find it. Also, when I want to share a tweet with a link, I would like that the "Share Text in Tweet" option doesn't change a link's text url to the actual url. I would hope it would keep the tweet text verbatim. Please fix? Great work team!

	   I've used every app available on the Play Store and I can say without a doubt this is my favorite. Do yourself a favor and try it. Great layout and features so far, and only getting better. Awesome developer behind it who is working hard and pushing out very quick updates. Just download the native Twitter app for push notifications for the time being and you are golden.

	   I do believe I'll be ditching the native Twitter app for this one. Have only played around with it for a few minutes, but I'm loving it so far. The context-based tweet composition is great, and swiping between categories (aka. personal, lists, etc.) is great. It's not exactly "buttery smooth" on my GNex running 4.1.1, but nothing debilitating. Great job so far; looking forward to future dev's.

	   This app is by far the best choice for Twitter on Android. The design is simple yet elegant. It's a fast, easy to use app, that blends in perfectly with the design of ICS. Chris is amazing at putting out updates in rapid fashion to fix bugs (what little there are) and to add features that those who follow him on Twitter suggest. Can't praise enough.

	<comment>
	   No notifications No lane customization Limited settings Hard to hit links By far the BEST Twitter client out there. The only one to effectively use lists! I un installed all other Twitter clients and wait eagerly for the release candidates posted by the dev almost daily.

	   Clean and functional, the best Twitter app I've used in terms of interface. There are some problems and omissions but the speed with which the developer has been fixing things and adding new features means I'm confident that a 5 star rating will be deserved.

	<comment>
	   Overall the app and design is well thought out. Good use of the design guidelines. The slightly different usage pattern for replying works nicely. Would be nice to see push notifications (twitter is slow at granting developers that though). Having the app handle twitter URLs and contact sync would also be nice.

	<comment>
	   First, this app have potential. The problem is that the developer doesn't answer to tweets if you have problems, the app is lagging, profile pictures doesn't fit, no DM, no location for your tweets and so on. The twitter app it's much better for now, my opinion. I will be back to this one and all the issues will be solved.

	<comment>
	   Tried this as my standard twitter apply, please Tweet Caster, was having issues on Nexus 7, opening links only to instantly close them. This works fast, is easy to use (much easier to get to list of who your following) and looks much less busy compared to Tweet Caster. Big thumbs up from me.

	<comment>
	   Tweetlanes has the honor of being the first decent android client out there. Whether it can withstand the threat of the impending Carbon for Android remains to be seen. Nevertheless this is some great work and should be celebrated. Developer is fast and responsive to comments, and pushes out updates really quickly. Client is elegant and beautiful and for a beta, already works very well. Some problems with clicking on links especially, but I'm sure that will be tweaked over time.

	<comment>
	   This app is great and gets updated rather quickly. There are still some features I wish to see, such as: -Filtering of hash tags/words -Ability to refresh timeline without automatically jumping to top (refresh from current position) -Smaller "New Tweet" notification in the app. Big blue banner is sort of annoying -DMs -Notification settings One other issue that still sometimes happens is the user image/avatar is slow to load for some people I follow. Overall, this app seems to get better with each release, and I can't wait to see what the next release entails.

	<title>Excellent new Twitter client</title>
	<comment>
	   Fast Twitter client, super clean design and fits in perfectly with ICS. Swiping left/right for lists, mentions, etc. is nice too. Image preview for major sites, like Instagram, is also handy. The official Twitter client needs a built in image viewer for links such as those. However, if you have a lot of lists, continuously swiping off to the right could become tiresome. The ability to add those I'm following to a list would also be welcome. Great work so far. Can't wait to see where you take this.

	   So far the best android twitter app i've used. Love the native look & feel, and it has a whole lot less bugs than Boid for example. It's very fast and smooth. My only piece of feedback would be the icon. It's not the best looking imo.

In future updates can you please put a notification feature and also a highlight feature so whenever I get mentioned it shows up on my time line. So far, it looks great and I'm on this app 100%! Keep up the great work and make this the #1 twitter replacement app!

	   Ui looks great, its fast and smooth and the UI philosophy wins me over, I think the omni tweet bar is what most twitter clients are missing. HOWEVER, this thing is still FAR too buggy and incomplete to be taken seriously, even as a beta. It wouldn't even let me finishing composing a tweet, kept taking focus away from the tweet bar. I'll check in later when its had the chance to mature functionally

	   This is a fantastic Twitter client. Probably the best ICS styled app so far. It could definitely use a dark theme (for power savings,) as well as some performance improvements when it comes to scrolling and image loading, but other than that, I have no issues using this app as a full time replacement. Bravo.

	   Take that tapbot (iphone)! I've been looking for an Android client that is functional and nice to look at. This is where my search stops. Forget the others, this is the best. As others have stated, I'd like to see a trending list of some sort. Other than that, it's a great app. By the way, in case you are wondering I'm running a rooted HTC One S with Android 4.0.4.

	   Tweet Lanes is great. It fits into the design language on Ice Cream Sandwich very well, it mimics the design that other Google-y apps uses. Everything is very clean and simple. The app provides a great walkthrough-tutorial explaining how it is different from other apps. The navigation is simple, swipe in the timeline and swipe left and right to get various other panes. Great app.

	   This app is obviously still young and many features have yet to be implemented, but I find myself using TL more then other clients. Once this app reaches maturity it'll be amazing. please don't stop dev, I want to give you 5 stars! Feature Request: Post to facebook as well as twitter. Then I can just get rid of Tweetdeck on my phone.

	<comment>
	   I needed to find a new Twitter client because I was tired of not being able to quote tweets on the official app. I chose this one because it was 1) Ad Free, 2) In active development and 3) Rocking a proper ICS style. I'm reserving my final star because it's obviously not feature-complete yet, but I am definitely going to give this a go as my primary client. BTW: previews from Instagram and Imgur are a big plus!

	   After working out that I was too impatient to determine how to follow someone, I have to agree with Jackson that there needs to be a contextual list of ppl you follow/follow you when you type the @ symbol. Apart from that this is a solid little app with a flourish of updates so soon :)

	   The absolute 鈥渕ust add鈥? feature you need to add next, would be to remember our place in the timeline while refreshing/updating. Also, while swiping to the right of the tweet, it would be great to have the app slide in a screen with all replies to that particular tweet.

	   Really really like the context tweet bar and tap tweets to multireply it's genius!!! Not quite 5 stars yet but if there was an option to have the mentions lists etc at the bottom instead of the top it would definitely be 5 stars!

	   The stock twitter app has always been my go to because it just works and works well. This app is GREAT and loaded with features. Patiently awaiting the widget though. How about a way to view conversations too? Probably the only things that are missing right now.

	<comment>
	   I really like the direction this app is going, especially with the picture previews. However some things still feel kinda wonky. As a slide out QWERTY user the lack of landscape support is a bit jarring and posting pictures seems to be broken too (at least for me). This app is still in it's early stages, and while I'm not ready to make this my dedicated Twitter client I can see it becoming that as it progresses, and I intend to keep testing it as it does so.

	<comment>
	   While the concept of the context button to streamline and unify twitter "actions" is a good idea, You should also add landscape rotation option to the default portrait for those of us who use this app in a tablet besides phones. another good option would be to be able to highlight an account and get context menu like "add to search" or "go to tweets" instead of having to go to the "following" tab and then having to click n the picture to be taken to the respective account.

	<title>Best design of any current Twitter app</title>
	<comment>
	   This is really a great look and feel. It's ICS clear, navigation is buttery and it feels like this could be Android's answer to iPhone's Tweetbot. Great start, hopefully Twitter doesn't destroy the API's for 3rd parties but let's hope for the best. Future suggestions: Tweetmarker, landscape keyboard, drafts, Readability/Pocket/Instapaper support within the TL, add/remove users from lists, perhaps a mobilized (Readability/Instapaper) version of a link just to name a couple. Some of those I'm sure are already on deck but still worth mentioning.

	   I love the new features like multiple replies, VolNav, the everpresent tweet dialog, and the overall layout is great! However, it FC'd when expanding a conversation from the "MyTweets" tab, also we should be able to rearrange the tabs layout (order them/ remove some), let us change the font size to, it's huge! Keep up the great job, but for now, uninstalled :)

	   It would be good if the apps got the ability to remember the last position of the timeline it was last browsed.. so users can just scroll upwards to the latest tweet in the timeline.. and the ability to resize text would be helpful..

	   Works swift , with the implementation of a few missing features such as notifications this will be the perfect twitter client for ICS devices.

	   If the dev keeps up their work it'll be the best twitter app out there. Suggested Upgrades: -@Mention and Direct Message Notifications -160+ character tweets shortened and URL added to tweet to read longer tweets (similar to tweetdeck) ---- -Create Columns (similar to tweetdeck) -Dark Holo theme -Share tweets -Save to Pocket

	   clean ui, innovative new tweet system! but need to add tweet feature caching because the app need to reload all tweets (which waste time considerably). keep up the good work! p.s. : the orange thingy is very attractive on my home screen icon oh, and a black themed UI could save my eyes on dark environtment :))

	<comment>
	   Good start, it's not the first ICS style twitter app, but it does it the best out of the lot, not quite ready to be a daily driver though, few key features are missing: No log out option? Layout of the the drop down at the top doesn't display too well - big margins? Icon isn't too great. Custom font size - I want to see more tweets without scrolling. Landscape mode? - or at least for when composing a new tweet, for a bigger keyboard? Better tablet support - Columns in a landscape mode would be nice. Widget Dark theme Muting Good points: Introduction slides where good, friendly and well done. ICS design executed perfectly - big plus! Unique features that make sense. Everything that works, seems to work well. Looking forward to seeing what comes of this, if these problems get fixed quick, I can see it becoming the top twitter client of choice :)

	   Suggestions: 1. Dark theme. 2. Hide all settings on top bar into the ICS 3 dot menu icon. 3. Auto disappear the timeline, mentions, my tweets etc bar to save room and show more and make it reappear when we side swipe. Other than that I see great potential

	<title>Could finally replace tweetdeck for me</title>
	<comment>
	   This seems like a great start so far, with an obviously still in development app. I've been looking for something clean and simple to replace tweetdeck for awhile, but nothing exists out there where I can use multiple accounts, choose columns, and not look completely terrible. I really think this might end up being it, since the visual style is great, the lanes are essentially like tweetdeck columns, and it has multiple account support. A killer feature going forwards would be allowing mixed lanes with the multiple account support instead of having to context switch the app between accounts. That, and the ability to pick which account to tweet FROM on the fly are the features that keep me going back to tweetdeck, so I'd love to see them in a slick app like this one.

	   Definitely my daily twitter app. Can't wait to see the new features as they are implemented. Even with some missing features it is the best twitter app for me. Only thing currently missing is the ability to resume the app at the point in your timeline you were at before refreshing or resuming the app. Keep up the great work!

	   It could use dark theme version. I read twits before sleep, white background is very harsh on the eyes in dark room. Option to change text size would be great too. While I can read 1/3 on the current size with ease, my kid has very poor eye sight. Allowing at least few size options would be great. Regardless, I love the app and the design, and I'm certainly moving from TweetDeck in favor to TweetLanes. Looking forward to more features.

	   Nice light weight twitter client. I'm going to check it out for a while. Giving it five stars because it does everything it says it will with no problems which is not a whole lot. Just pure twitter. And to one reviewer those are lanes not feet under the bird. Tweet lanes.

	<title>Great early start - interface looks ICSdelicious</title>
	<comment>
	   Great early start - here's my positives, followed by a wishlist for features: Positives: Super fast, nice switching mechanism, love the multiple select options, love the quick access to lists and favourites (something the stock official app makes hard to find), beautiful ICS official look to it all, love the inline images + vid options. Bonus: hasn't crashed or stalled once yet even with heavy use and fast screen switching etc, with one exception (see below) Wishlist/Comments: Can't figure out how to view a conversation (@ reply flow), can't figure out how to add an image or vid to a tweet, would like to see the android ICS dark theme as well as the stock light theme, Didn't like app icon being put on my screen automatically (I have that disabled - how did the app get around it?), needs Settings available soon for img hosting options, notifications, all the usual stuff. When sending img from gallery, it just goes to a black screen, so a bug or something (pulling img from google cloud); also, would like landscape view (split screen maybe?)

	   App is amazing, unfortunately it's missing one essential feature i can't use a twitter client without, real-time notifications, Twitter doesn't provide the API's but some developers made real-time notifications themselves. So until we see some kind of real-time notifications it's a 4 but amazing nevertheless

	<comment>
	   The Dev has certainly put a lot of thought into how you actually USE Twitter, and it shows. Lots of smart ways of doing things. Version 0.1.9: I kept hitting "This feature is not quite ready!" warnings, so there are definitely some missing features. You can't even get into the settings! I'm sure this will be a very straing app by version 1.0
