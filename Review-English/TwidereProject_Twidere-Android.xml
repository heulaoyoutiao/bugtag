	   When I open the app they come up. I have them set for every 3 mins but they fail to let me when I get new tweets. It's been 3 weeks and the notifications STILL don't won't and Android 7.0 devices they don't work on my Nexus 6P or my V20. The app did no one any good when you can't even get new tweets

	  After deleting and reinstalling yet again notifications are still telling me about things that happened several days ago. Also, I loaded it today and all of my tabs had been reset and I had to set them up again. Sadly it's always one step forward and 2 steps back with this app. The new square icon is also awful.

	<comment>
	   It's tricky to use with multiple accounts and no way to view "activity" in addition to "mentions". Also found it would hang while fetching new tweets or silently fail at refreshing. I like the dark colour theme and a lot of the design, but it's not reliable enough for me.

	   I love it! Pure twitter experience without all the things that the official app shovels down your throat, like the "while u were away" section. And what I love most about this app is that it keeps up with the latest the Android has to offer, like app shortcuts and inapp chrome browser... Love it! And it's also crazy customizable!

	<title>Useful & Good App, But Its Using Permission: "Precise GPS Locations", "Identity", etc.</title>
	<comment>
	   Twidere has many +points: Free, AD-free, uses Encrypted TLS/SSL, etc. So it can be best, if it is further improved. Inside Settings, an option is necessary to keep AnyType Location access Disabled, in that way, it wont by mistake access+add such data. It should not access "identity". Pls add an option to retwit a twit/rt without goin thru "cancel-retweet" step, as that removes the twit from list, & findin agn is tuff :( Thanks.

	   The scrolling tab bar is a bit hard to use on my 4.5" phone screen, so a dropdown list when the app only has room to show one tab's contents would be a handy option, imo. Beyond that, this app has practically everything. Full list support, including editing lists, pic previews, etc.

	<title>Odd message behaviour</title>
	<comment>
	   V3.2.9 on marshmallow z3 compact. If you refresh messages you only get some retrieved. Example: I used to get TFL alert messages. If you delete the latest ones and refresh, earlier ones get retrieved. None of my messages from other people appear at all, I guess because there's some kind of date based or volume limitation imposed. Also, you can delete an entire conversation, only individual messages, one at a time. Pretty painful if you're trying to clean up messages.

	   Modern permissions - turn off location on recent android versions. Square profile pictures - you don't have put up with "material" round icons. Combined timeline across your accounts. Customise tweet reading with many options. The best Twitter client I've come across. Very clean design. A great upgrade from tweet lanes.

	   Kindly improve it. For single account it is very good. I would like to upgrade my rating. I appeal to developers not to abandon the development of this app. Make it the BEST Twitter client. I know you can do it. Bring in online TWEET translation please.

	   This is perfect for a twitter app client! But i can't seek the time when i played a video (like twitter). Because it wasted for waiting a long video, seek is important to played the video. Maybe you can updated this feature in soon version. But over all, i liked the design and tool of settings.

	  The app is better than most out there. The layout is efficient and easy to use. My only issues are that it does not send me notifications or message updates. If those were fixed would definitely give it a 4 star ratings. UPDATE: Had to uninstall due to the fact that I didn't get notifications or message updates. Real shame.

	   The best Twitter client so far though it's a bit laggy. Besides, it'd be better if you cache medias so they won't be reloaded all the time.

	   I manage 2 twitter accounts, my own & one for a small nonprofit. My first tweet out of this app was a personal opinion sent from my personal account. Imagine my horror when the app simultaneously posted it from the nonprofit account. Not cool! I had to swoop in & delete right away. Plus it posted this Tweet twice from each account. Promptly uninstalled the app.

	<comment>
	   1: the most important thing is to add a material desing in the app not just a twitt button . 2 : this blue color is bad on the app you need to make it more bluer 3 : i cant copy the twitt why ? 4 : you need to make the load for videos and pic faster ( some times the pic and videos don't work as will laging and freezing on it ) 5 : i think you forgottn to make the pic don't count from the 140 ;) 聽you can make it wonderful twitter app thx for this app :)

	   This is the perfect Twitter app except for the fact that I can't selectively receive notifications from certain accounts. It's either all accounts or none. I just want to receive tweets from a certain group of users when im outside the app and this app cannot do that yet.

	   Merges multiple accounts into one timeline and there is no way to get around that. This is ridiculous. only recommended if you have one account. seeing one timeline is impossible. App appears to be a copycat of Plume minus the ads in many ways. App is missing translate feature. Trends feature doesn't work. Interactions missing features too. it's not intuitive as well. rather complicated. So very few downloads. not recommended. Avoid

The timeline shows posts several hours out of date and times out when I try to update it. I have tried on WiFi and a 4G connection. Twitter official and Talon update the timeline in seconds. Twidere times out.

	   The app is working great for me so far, a minor inconvenience that I have is that the app won't show likes/retweets in the interactions (unless I'm missing it). Also, I seem to remember being able to send pictures in DMs via Twidere, has it been removed or am I missing something again? Otherwise great app, would recommend, keep up the good work.

	<comment>
	   This superior alternative to the official twitter app was working perfectly before. As usual, I immediately regret updating it due to regressions. (Intermittently stops loading anything, sometimes even mere seconds after restart) I don't get why this happens with every major update of this app, but I should have known and have waited.

	<comment>
	   This app used to be just short of perfect...5 star quality. Now the app barely works at all. Timeline doesn't refresh unless you go into settings, force stop, then relaunch the app, but when you try to refresh for more tweets, same thing. Media doesn't open. 3.2.4 update didn't fix ANYTHING. It's now a useless app taking up space on my phone. The developers used to do a really good job of fixing bugs and adding features and addressing requests but not this time SMH looking for a new app that actually works.

	<comment>
	   Continually fails to post tweets. Draft tweets can't be deleted (if they can, it's not obvious how). GUI is generally unintuitive. Overall, pretty damn useless...

	<comment>
	   Over the years, I've bought and tried Tweetings, Tweetcaster, Plume, and Uber. I am SO glad I didn't listen to the negative reviews posted here! This app works flawlessly on My LG G4. Loaded with options, pleasing to the eye, and intuitive to navigate. I bought the dev's wallpaper to contribute to the app's further development, and hope that he won't be discouraged by the critics.

	   The apps customization and design is pretty fantastic in itself but for some reason, pictures load but in order to look at it full-screen, I have to restart the app. I have to do the same when refreshing tweets. Good besides the constant app restarting.

	   I loved this at first other than the multiple accounts sharing a timeline. I just disabled the accounts when I needed to, so no big deal. But as of late. My feed doesn't refresh, even manually. Pictures won't expand, and some videos and gifs won't load. Gifs also completely stop my media player so it's annoying even viewing a gif. You can't click to see who liked your tweets and you won't ever get notified for dms.

	<comment>
	   1. This app is great and customizable but it's still missing some important things.. I somehow can't get quote and faves to show up on Interaction. Then there is no Poll option. It would be great if twidere has those fixed.. that if it's possible, knowing that twidere is a 3rd party app and it has its limitation. 2. Just now, the timeline can't be refreshed. It seems the problem is not from twitter or my internet connection because they both work well.

	   Mostly good but I cannot figure out how to get it to stop running in background, which is why I uninstalled eventually. Also, needs to keep reloading pictures a: when a tweet is seen in timeline b: when one clicks on the picture c: when the phone is turned to the side and the screen changes. This is a serious problem on low bandwidth and limited data.

	<comment>
	   Like it but some annoying issues. Whenever i leave the timeline & return, it will reload whatever that it has already uploaded earlier. I have to wait before getting to continue reading my tweets. Why the need to keep reloading (unless i refresh it)? Does not remember last read position even after i set it in the settings. Every time i click out of timeline & return, i'll have to scroll & search where i stopped earlier. Please fix & it'll be a 5 star worthy app.

	<comment>
	   Dear developers. We'll done on creating an app fo Twitter that feels nice to use and looks good. One issue I do have is the inability to carry on down to look at older tweets on my feed. The official app has the same issue and it's really annoying. Not everything is only relevant in the 24 hours (or less) after it is posted. Otherwise I've enjoyed using the app and prefer to the official and the couple unofficial I have tried

	   Interactions is missing favourites & retweets. Font colour is a bit too bright on the dark theme. Square profile pictures doesn't work for DM. And many settings have only one option, so why are they even there?..

	  Hi. I'm wondering where I can see those other notifications like who like and retweet my tweet. I reinstalled this app again just to see in interactions those only who mentioned me unlike before that i can see those other thing that I mentioned. I don't forgot if there is a option of it in settings. I really love this app tbh Edit: Nevermind i got it already xD I'm used to put the code before and forgot that i should do it.

	<comment>
	   There is a lot to like about this app. Reminds me of Tweetdeck in many ways. But the most important thing is the URL shortener to me. Twidere makes your long urls into facebook links. I despise that in other's posts, making you click on through . (i never use Pinterest for that reason and avoid it in search results too) So I went back to Hootsuit. I dont like the way it looks as well but great URL shortening.

	  Better than Hootsuite that's all I can say. Decent Tweetdeck replacer and has the main requirements...multiple account management, real-time feed, able to see images on feed, able to see animated GIFs on feed (sort-of...it'd be better if you don't switch to a new window just to see a gif.) And the only thing it lacks is able to see 3rd-party videos inside the app and watch in it, example you can't watch Vines or Youtubes, nor can you even see the thumbnails, which irritate me. There are also some links that would display a thumbnail image for Twitter, but won't display on this app which is also irritating. These things I feel should be on all Twitter apps. And lacking one or more just slows down the speed at which you can do things.

	   Still best twitter option but new updates break functionality. Stop updating you are making it worse! Timelines randomly refuse to update, require you to kill the task repeatedly to refresh, and polls are still not supported. So bad now it's unusable now. After a year of use I give up.

	<comment>
	   Why can I not view interactions like when someone follows me, likes my tweet or retweets? Is that a limitation of the Twitter API or just developer incompetence? I don't believe it's the latter since the UI is generally well done, though you should tell users that they have to hit their system's back button to apply settings. I kept wondering why my tabs weren't showing after setting them and pressing the "back" arrow at the top.

	   I don't get notifications of any of my mentions and only got to realize this when using the Web version of Twitter. Even after reinstalling and going over settings extensively. Otherwise would have been a great app. EDIT: also please fix the search bar. One can't edit the search bar after it has already shown results of a previous search, and has to go back to the search page for the search icon

	   Definitively the best Twitter client out there, JUST makes sure to use an official API key to avoid refresh limits and other stuff twitter unfairly restricts 3rd party devs to. The UI is nice, clean and highly customisable. Using multiple accounts is near seamless and Tabs work very well, which is a godsend to the power user like me. Push notifications would be a very nice addition, but that's about it.

	   Depending on how important certain features are to you, you may be turned off from Twidere. For the most part, Twidere is an excellent Twitter client. It's fast and looks great. However, there are some features missing/problems that make the app difficult to use e.g. cannot crop/edit images before uploading them, getting slow or no notifications, and the "quote tweet" function seems to work differently than on the normal Twitter app. Hope the developer can sort this out.

	   PLEASE support the new retweet function-- in the mentions! It makes no sense to be able to use the new RT function and view it on the TL, but not be able to view the ones in my mentions from others who reply to me. Very tired of having to switch over to the native twitter app to see and reply to them.

	<comment>
	   It seems that it's impossible to properly cache media in the app, regardless of settings and database/cache size. Every time I scroll down my timeline, media that were previously loaded will load again. This reduces performance and makes scrolling janky. App is way less fluid than other clients.

	   Fantastic twitter client. The only thing I miss is, links 'options' like opening the link in 'browser' or save it to 'pocket' or 'readability' or saving to read it later.

	  I love twidere, the UI is simplistic and very user-friendly. I just wish I could receive DM notification. I have changed the consumer key/secret and have received the full interaction tab (RT, favourite, quote and mentions) but no DM notification. Am I doing something wrong because I tried finding solution on github and couldn't find any. Thanks!

	   I don't like the fact that I have to open media (pic, gif, videos) in browser. If not, there was only blank and black page when i clicked on the media. I have to uninstall because it was troublesome. Other than that, i really love the customizable features in it. I really hope there will be improvement regarding the media problem. Thank you very much.

	  Was pretty stoked to switch twitter apps since Plume was failing for me, but even they don't cover the majority of options including the send tweet button when composing a tweet! How is that an oversight? Or maybe it's just a problem with Swiftkey users?

	<comment>
	   The most beautiful, slick & smart Twitter app I've used by far. A couple of major issues though (otherwise I'd readily rate 5 stars): (1) Trend location allows user to specify - great - but it doesn't display the correct local trends? (2) Notifications: Only displays responses to @user - doesn't show any other interactions sadly? (3) Twitter polls aren't shown / enabled. Much appreciated! 馃槑

	<comment>
	   I've known about Twidere for years, but for some reason I never made the switch until today. This is by far the best Twitter app I've ever used. There's just one thing that keeps it from being flawless, and that's the search history that I can't seem to clear or disable. Gmail does something similar and it's always bugged me to no end. Maybe there's an option I'm missing that gets rid of it. Other than that, this is fantastic and it's always nice to see third-party open-source Twitter applications.

	  The only major problem is Twidere can't reliably load older tweets. That issue makes Twidere half-useless for me. I have to switch to another app to read all the tweets I missed!

	<comment>
	   Twidere is simply the most customizable app. But needs more features such as photo-tagging feature, schedule tweets, ability to retweet from other accounts, live streaming timeline, tweeting beyond 140 character limit via TwitLonger and more, but also fix the likes feature because I have difficulty liking tweets . But all in all, the best app so far.

	   My new favorite Twitter client. Nice, clean, customizable, and it works they way I want (and expect) it to work. Never had it lose my place, muting works great, and best of all: no "blue line" grouping. Read your Twitter the way it's supposed to be.

	  Works fine for the most part, a bit clunky. One function I'd suggest though is the option to notify based on a specific tab. I don't want to get a notification for everything in the app. Sometimes I want a notification only for messages, or searches whenever there's an update.

	<comment>
	   I've been looking for a good free twitter app for my tablet and this one is one of the best. Really love the clean look and the simplicity. Only thing its missing is a few things which I'd like, such as the ability to see who retweeted or liked your tweet and the ability to jump to the top of lists with a simple tap among other small things, but an excellent client overall!

	   Absolutely love this app, but really, really wish accidentally pressing the back-button while in my timeline (or changing orientation) wouldn't send me to the top of my timeline on next open. The developer has done great work on this app, and I'm grateful for it, but very annoying bug. When fixed, will give 5 stars.

	<comment>
	   Ever since the last series of updates loading takes forever and most of the time wont work unless i force start the app and start it again, sometimes it takes a couple of those to get it to refresh the home page. It now skips hours of time in my feed and has no way to see them. Pictures and video will load but then after the fully load im greeted with a black screen and it wont show the media unless i force stop and restart it.

	<comment>
	   I would like to see the tabs scale to the display size on landscape mode - if I only have 2 tabs, it only takes up half of the screen. Wasted space is you ask me. Also how do I see who favourites my tweets? Pressing the number of favourites doesn't do anything and in the notifications I don't get any about who favourited the tweet. Fix that and the app will be perfect.

	  If you find after the update that you loose all your tweets and the refresh hangs or does nothing. Just un-install the app and re-install got things working again for me. You loose all your preferences but small price to pay to get this app working again. Possible that the app makers need to review there upgrade methodology as something needs fixing!

	<comment>
	   Hello, this app is the best and I really love it, but in direct messages have a lot of problems. Doesn't have any kind of options like share, expand image or even copy and when ppl share a link you don't receive the complete link so you can't see what others shared with you. Plis fix to put 5* again.

	<comment>
	   I've experimented with at at least a dozen Twitter apps, and in the past have used Carbon and TweetCaster as my daily drivers. But Twidere is better than either of those very good apps in almost every way...If you can get it set up on your device, which requires some geek cred to pull off.

	   But it sometimes (okay most of the time) doesn't allow pull to refresh to work. Over the last week there have been several updates per day and noe many things are broken, like viewing profiles and tapping inline images in quoted tweets. Still better than default twitter app though.

	<title>Best free twitter app</title>
	<comment>
	   I have been searching for the best twitter app for a long long time, and I can finally say I found it. Quality work has obviously been put in designing this app, and I foresee myself using this for a long time. My only minor gripe is that when opening pictures from a tweet, the images could pop up and expand to full size over the client instead of opening in a different viewer altogether.

	<comment>
	   I'm really enjoying my experience with Twidere so far. I am coming from Fenix and was disappointed with the experience I was getting there. So far I am loving Twidere and anything which bothered me I could change in the apps robust settings. My only complaint is that sometimes when scrolling between tabs it gets stuck. It becomes a bit choppy when scrolling fast but other than that I have no complaints.

	   Just downloaded this app after using Falcon Pro for so long and I love the display and the smooth transitions. The main discontent I have is the lack of internal browser bc that was what I loved most about Falcon pro. So I haven't deleted Falcon yet but still trying out this one to see if I can get used to it. I really hope that twidere could include an internal browser so that I could jump ship

	   Found Twitter was getting really annoying, hence the switch. However, why do I keep getting repeat notifications that someone has replied to a tweet when I've already seen them? Also, I don't seem to be able to set up text notifications when someone tweets.

	   After coming from iOS, I struggled to find a twitter client I liked. This is the best I've used, not quite as good as tweetbot (iOS) but the best android one, the only feature its missing is streaming. Also there's no sync options, just blank!? Also when opening tweets from chrome I wish it was a bit wider, say 80% width.

	<comment>
	   I'm using Twidere over all other options but it has persistent issues. It frequently stops updating, requiring a force close to fix. And also the notification behaves poorly, and doesn't update the new tweet count based on the count in the app - the only thing that sets the notification count to zero is swiping away the notification, not actually reading tweets.

	   ...In the background too, and when opted out of sending usage statistics. Obviously this shouldn't be necessary especially when the official Twitter app doesn't even do it. It's a shame because the app is really nice compared to other third party apps (sidenote: imo the official app is best but with ads being a major drawback).

With a lot of features Twidere is the only client that never lacks of features. The developer listen to you and try to fix bugs as fast as possible. It's also free AND ad-free. This is how you browse Twitter!

	   However there are some features that I miss from other clients such as interacting with the app, closing tweets and media you've opened by simply swiping. If this was implemented, that would improve the UI navigation. And of course, waiting on the streaming plugin.

	   I wonder if Twidere have this function where we can get a notification every time a specific user posted a new tweet? I switched to Twidere bc of its lightweightness & customable design. So far it's been good. Yet I need that user notification feature to be in it.

	  The overall design is amazing, and the other great features are what makes this the Twitter app of many people's dreams, including mine too. But I just wish it wouldn't combine all accounts' timelines together, because it gets confusing as I don't follow the same people on either of them. I mean like I really don't want to see my different accounts' timelines and notifications combined in one place. Please do something about that and then I'll give the 5 stars you guys actually deserve.

	   I used to love this app. Since the last update, whenever I go to view the latest tweets, it shows me about 3 hours of new tweets before going to tweets from 4 days ago. I'd like to see the tweets in between those two time frames, please! This is why I abandoned the real Twitter app in the first place.

	<comment>
	   This app is incredible. Saving gifs, no ads, dark theme, it's a twitter dream come true. But there are things that should be added to make it perfect. First, there needs to be a tab for other notifications, such as likes, retweets and follows by other people. Second, there should be a preview thumbnail for YouTube links. I would say that displaying replies needs to be improved as well, but you have already explained why that is impossible. When my suggestions are added, I can delete the default twitter app.

	   Official Twitter app began lagging to the point it was unusable so I tried this and a couple other replacements. This one was my fav, so I'll use it for now. No ads, and loads faster than the official app ever did. Just wish vines played and external link previews showed up for images other than instagram. Also there's a space character that shows up as "鈰哱" for some reason. It shows fine in the other twitter apps. User tiny_star_field has it all over, for reference. And there's currently no poll support.

	   Recently the app is not sending tweets, they immediately go to drafts. After a while, it may go after several tries, but often revert back to Twitter to send. Also, time line not updated occasionally and unable to view favorite tweets. I prefer this app, especially since twitlonger is available, please help...

	<title>Loved it, but lists stopped working after a week</title>
	<comment>
	   I loved that I could customize tabs with this app, and access my lists instead of the entire list of people I followed, but after being unable to refresh them for four days, I tried to delete and add the list back. Twidere crashed every time I tried to access my lists. If this gets fixed, let me know- unfortunately, as this was the feature that drew me to this app, I'm looking for an alternative now.

	   I love this app, but it needs group dm support. It's very inconvenient to switch apps to see my group dm messages. Thanks. 5 stars when you can fix that.

	<title>Just a few suggestions</title>
	<comment>
	   It could be super convenient if I could go to someone's profile and there be a tab that just has their tweets with pics and videos. Also it would be nice if somehow tweets with other languages could be translated within the app all. I follow a lot of kpop groups and fan accounts and I have to copy and paste constantly to translate on Google. It almost made me uninstall the app. But I'm sure you guys are probably working on that.

	  This app is awesome. Sure you can find some errors while using it but come on, someone has taken time to do an open source app so you can have a non-ad free forever Twitter app. It works great, it is always improving and it has everything you can already find in twitter. The material design is beautifully made and the logo design is the best. Thank you for your time to do this awesome app. I update this opinion to say that I had to uninstall the app, it had a hard time refreshing the timeline and it has become outdated since the new twitter features.

	   By far the best twitter app in the market. Like the best open source software , simple but powerful, does one thing and does it well. Doesn't require a bunch of permissions and you to give up all your privacy to use. My one minor complaint is the settings layout took a few minutes to figure out. But I did figure it out and so will you.

	   Users of this app should be able to see notifications on who followed them, Who retweeted their tweets and who favorited whatever they posted. Also, media files are supposed to repeat after full play. Having to go back before playing it again is unpleasing. All other stuff are very cool tho.

	   Recently switched to a Galaxy S6, and now the app lags when moving too fast through the tweets. Also, sometimes I can't get new tweets, even though my Internet connection is fine. Otherwise, best twitter app for catching up on news and people.

	   Overall a great client, but lacks of instant push notification. Notification only works with interval reload of timeline which cause delay in notification. Not so practical. And also replies aren't grouped together under the first tweet, which makes timeline messy

	<comment>
	   Very nice Twitter client..! :D but I found a problem that the pinned tweet is not supported for now. (Tweets can't to be a pinned, Pinned tweet doesn't move to top of timeline in profile page...e.t.c) I hope that would be implemented in future updates.

	<comment>
	   Setting a custom notification ringtone doesn't work. Just uses the default one. Really nice design, smooth interface, but a bit buggy. I like to know when I'm getting a tweet vs a text.

	<comment>
	   Overall a beautiful and well working app. But there are two issues: in messages, the enter key does not work as a ljne break, even if "enter for send" is deactivated. Second, the edit media button does nothing for me. I would like to at least be able to crop a picture. Will give 5 stars if these are changed.

	   It's bugging me that no new notifications are sent after new people followed me, and no notifications on who retweeted or favorites my tweets. but other than that it's really a well made app and should recognized more. Keep up the good work.

	  I've used pretty much every twitter app and there were some that I really liked. Twidere beats them all though! It takes a little tweaking and setup at first but you end up with the smoothest Twitter experience of any app out there right now. This app definitely deserves a paid version.

	   The only issue I'm experiencing is that it will periodically stop loading new tweets when I refresh. I have to force close and re-open to get things working again. I don't know if this is a known issue, but once it's fixed I'm definitely giving 5 stars.

	  as a twitter user 24/7, the customization features which the twitter app doesnt have fulfill this app, however it has synchronization issues e.g loading new tweets, sending tweets and inability to edit photos like cropping on the spot but the rest are perfect! Will highly recommend this if the issues will be fixed.

	  After trying almost every free Twitter app out there this is what I was looking for. THIS is how you do a Twitter client right. Theme and card customization. Tabbing for what I want with icons and ability to reorder. Incoming DM's that don't get shortened and ability to send long DM's unlike Twittnuker. One thing I would ask for is more tab icon options. Twittnuker has a few more icon options. Any extras would be nice, but I personally would prefer icons representing something with music, movies, books, and games for different list types.

	<comment>
	   Lots of bugs, for instance I had to restart before the tabs were actually there. Otherwise it just keeps requesting you to make tabs. Then I tried to send a message, but the send button doesn't seem to be working. It's a pity really, it's very pretty but at this point unusable. Hope it gets more stable in the future!

	  Obviously a bit of a work-in-progress but certainly good work! Handles multiple accounts with shared timelines, so already streaks ahead of other Material Design Twitter apps. A few bugs here and there, but it's customisable enough to adapt to most casual uses. Overall a great app, it'll be a shame when Twitter forces its users elsewhere.

	  Multiple accounts with merged timelines are a big plus! Seems to run fairly well. Despite developer's claims to the contrary, it constantly loses your timeline place. Doesn't load all missing tweets. Doesn't reset notifications when you get new mentions. Fix these issues and it would be the best Twitter client I've ever used.

	  Tested many clients, but this is the only one that maintains balance between good design and usefulness without any clutter. It lacks Twitter's search (ability to search for any profile or hash tag), which I personally find very important, and often glitches/gets stuck while loading and needs better, simpler notification overview.

	<title>An excellent free Twitter client</title>
	<comment>
	   This app has an excellent, highly customisable user interface and all the features I need - I've uninstalled Falcon Pro 3 and Plume. The fact that this app is free, ad-free and open source shows that the developer cares less about money and more about actually making a great Twitter client. It has a few bugs, but none that stop this app from being a pleasure to use. The screenshots don't make it look that impressive, but I definitely recommend trying it out.

	  The best Twitter client I've found. This is how the official Twitter app should look like, IMO, respecting the Material design, providing smooth and customizable user experience, etc. It is sometimes not completely polished yet but I'd take Twidere over any other Twitter client, including the official one, any time.

	<comment>
	   The user experience of this app is amazing and among the best apps I've used hands down. The Material Design is nicely executed, and the interface customisation. However I'm disappointed with the lack of Android Wear support, as much could be done in terms of reading tweets and notification center.

	   A very good, stable twitter client. Even though it's now my daily driver, there's a couple of quirks (could be me though!): I can't see who retweets messages, and the API key situation is a bit unclear (should I still be using my own api key?)

	<comment>
	   I love a lot about this application, but it does have bugs. Sometimes it won't refresh and I have to force close it and open it back up. Also, there is no view within the app for notifications and clicking on favorite/retweet counters doesn't show who favorited/retweeted. The biggest but, though, is that if you don't use it for a few hours, it can be missing a lot of tweets that would show up in the official app.

	   Linking tabs to specific accounts. Lite image editor extension, to crop screenies before tweeting them and the like. Retweet options, I really don't wanna quote everything I retweet. User filter doesn't seem to be working, least not for me, though I can mute words just fine.

	<comment>
	   I like the customization. I do not like how smashed together everything feels. I wish there was a setting to change how large the space between tweets and the space between reply, retweet, and favorite. The official Twitter interface feels much smoother. I wish the "retweeted by" text was larger. Love the IG previews. Dislike the way I can't just have a notifications tab. There is no way for me to be notified if someone favorites a tweet of mine.

	  No longer works for its purpose. NEVER sends a tweet within the app even when its just text. It just says 'sending tweet' for hours in the notifications. Yet if I share something from another app to Twidere its fast to send. Je ne comprends?! And the way it loads or the way the notification tab is done is terrible. Im done. Uninstalling. (OneplusOne)

	   Fast, clean UI with easy to use side swipe between columns. Few deal-breakers are: refresh jumps to top of timeline rather than remembering your place, no in-app browser, cannot choose alternate image upload service. Amazingly comprehensive app otherwise, and truly beautiful.

	  Good design although some animations still need some polishing. Also, is it possible to add a tab that's similar to the notifications tab of the normal Twitter app?

	   Well designed and beautiful but buggy. Can't see who has retweeted a tweet, or who has faved. Changing the app's type to Light or Condensed still doesn't change it in the app itself. Sometimes replies do not show up.

	   For the most part I really like it, but whenever my screen flips for some reason all the stored tweets I had just vanish and I get sent to the most recent. It's super annoying since I don't check my twitter constantly so I'm always quite behind on tweets.

	   Overall it's far better than the vanilla twitter client, but sadly, the edit media option is defunct and the mentions tabs don't show favourites and retweets from other users to your tweets. Will change to 5 stars after that is fixed.

	   Not a bad program, but as soon as I installed my account was starting to follow multiple users I wasn't aware of. I'm not sure if this issue with the app or my account so I'm not going to hold the Ap responsible but there was a lot of lag issues and issues trying to post and follow other people on Twitter. I'm giving 2 stars for now until the issues are fixed and I can straighten out my account

	   there's a bug, when u are trying to reply, app set user nickname after @, not twitter user name. Like @Ivan Ivanov instead of @Ivanoff scroll between tabs is buggy, a lot of lags here and there. Launching animation is different on android 5

	   Can't see who favourited or retweeted a tweet. Can't tap notifications to go to the related tweet. Would be nice to able to view the media tab and tap objects to view them fully. As it is now you only get a preview.

	   This is the cleanest free twitter app out there. One thing that should be added is to see a tab and/or notifications for favorites. I still plan on keeping the app and holding out for favorites. Keep up the good work!

Sometimes when I swap screen to left, there is a grey blank space in the right side and I can't move it. Btw in addition, please add "back to top" :D and now I'm waiting for twidere for facebook :3

	   I love the way it looks and really wish it worked for me. But the screen just stays white with no tweets. Won't let me add any tabs. Doesn't show notifications or DMs. And after a while it just freezes up. Two stars for good looks.

	   Don't get me wrong I love this app, but maybe make it so I can get a notification when someone retweets, and favorites. Please update that other than that, FANTASTIC Also if you could make it so I can get push notifications as soon as it happens rather than when I open the app it happens?

	<comment>
	   I just fall in love with everything other than the problem. You can always change the setting to see tweets refreshed from latest to newest or otherwise, my problem is that I have chosen the shortest interval but still having trouble to refresh new tweets. Also, you can always change the pic to be a link or not.

	  While I enjoy the UI, multi-account tweeting, etc. It has ridiculous loading times, sometimes not even loading the tweet/picture/profile and instead giving you an error. It notifies you of an interaction as late as FORTY MINUTES later. Definitely NOT a good alternate Twitter app.

	<comment>
	   This would be 4, maybe 5 stars if notifications weren't a problem. There's no way to control how often the accounts sync, so notifications are several minutes behind the Twitter app, if I see them at all. I wanted to replace the Twitter app, but the slow and erratic notifications prevent me from doing so.

	   I tried a lot of twitter apps & I like this one best. Very nice design & function. Love the customization especially in choosing a color, there's a lot of choices! But ability to see users that retweet & favorite a tweet doesn't work. Also would like to be able to see more replies to a tweet. I'm really curious of people's responses to a tweet sometimes. xP Its great overall tho so keep it up!! 鈽呪槅鈽?

	   This app is like twicca - fast, free and customizable but also looks great on modern android handsets. Only issue for me is that the transparency slider for the background doesn't work. EDIT: wish there was a way to change the colour of the floating "new tweet" button. There's no contrast between the button and the timeline.

	  I want to like this app because it's lovely, but it appears to be skipping tweets. It loads an incredibly small number of tweets at a time upon refresh, and hitting the Load More line fails to load the tweets in between. This is literally the exact reason I am looking for a replacement for Twicca, since its latest update started doing the same thing. The problem here is, there's no way to force reload the whole timeline to retrieve those missing tweets.

	   This is the first app I've installed that won't open in the Android M preview. I get that it's still a beta, which is why I gave it 5 stars (don't want to affect their ratings based on a beta) but it's disappointing since it's the only Twitter client that doesn't have sketchy permissions. Not sure what could be causing the error but let me know once you've sorted it.

	<comment>
	   Love the look, and it's quite smooth most of the time, but it crashes from time to time, and with the latest update (I think), the Load More button after the most recent tweets doesn't seem to work - loading icon appears for a half second the goes, and the tweets aren't shown. Shame.

	<comment>
	   It's a little concerning to me that the developer seems to disregard some feature requests, including one I thought would be a major UI improvement, with little discussion over the merits. However, this is an outstanding Twitter app with some very nice features. Not perfect but the best Twitter client I've been able to find.

	   Lovely looking and functional app which I enjoyed using, but I uninstalled it because it was using an extraordinary amount of power on my HTC one m8 - over 40% of screen off usage. Shame, because it's great apart from that. I'm only a casual twitter user, so if I could deactivate it when not in use it would save a lot of battery.

	<comment>
	   I really like being able to change how it looks and all the open source stuff. The main reason I was looking for a new twitter app is the official one only showing a certain number of tweets on a person's profile.. but this one seems to show all tweets. The one thing I couldn't work out is why I can't see who has favourited a tweet. I can't find a notification tab for it or even if I click on the number of favourites on the tweet nothing happens. I think I will stick with this app though..seems good.

	   However, the loading symbol never ceases on the trends tab, and a lot of the time tweets don't load at all for me on the timeline/home tab, it just stops.

	   I have had some time on this Twitter client and I cannot say that I am wow-ed. Performance is still pretty choppy (Galaxy S4), UI seems pretty cluttered and unspaced. Also, Twitter cards don't seem to appear, retweet with comment is absent and some media (i.e. Vine) is not supported.

	<comment>
	   Am loving Twidere. Unlike other twitter apps, Twidere is able to load all of my timeline as opposed to other apps. With other apps I could only load timelines upto the last one or two hours max, thus missing important tweets. It needs some more work for sure, e.g. It needs to have Retweet With Comment. Also needs to have an option to select smaller Media pictures, at the moment they are too big (expensive data). Good job guys.

	<title>Nice UI, But Problems</title>
	<comment>
	   I love the UI, and that this is ad-free/open-source. However, a few problems make this app unusable for me. (1) Refreshing the timeline goes to the top, losing my place among the tweets I was reading, requiring a lot of downscrolling to find where I left off. (2) There's no number indicator for how many unread tweets are left. (3) I can't find an obvious way to read a tweet in context of a conversation, which makes many tweets useless. (4) On the trends tab, the loading icon never goes away. (5) Every time I open it, I have to dismiss a notification at the top about "usage statistics".

	   I actually like how this looks a lot more than TweetCaster. A few things I would change though: refreshing, I wish it would refresh from that post, up, so I could read oldest to newest & not newest to oldest. Also, I don't like the pics showing up as links.

	   After trying just about every Twitter client out there, I think Twidere is "the one". Multiple accounts, filtering, custom API keys, and the ability to customize it to a truly satisfying degree. Just about the only thing it's missing is a proper widget!

	<comment>
	   I only check Twitter a few times a day so I keep this app in offline mode. When I manually refresh, it only loads a few (no more than 15 tweets) at a time, so I have to manually update many times to see what I've missed. Other than this, no issues.

	  the twitter client that fits my needs the most. it's preferrable if the ui is more minimalist though but it's nice it has so much flexibility in terms of ui. also twitter has updated its quoting mechanism, with the quote showing a preview in the tweet, maybe you can also include that feature in the next update. thanks!

	   I honestly feel like this is the best app for using twitter. However, i cannot view who favorites my tweets. Is this a compatibility issue or is this a problem for all devices? Regardless, if problem is addressed and fixed, this app is easily one of the best apps for social media and gets 5 stars from me. Edit: something else I've noticed, videos have no sound.

	   I like the design and all the features it has. It is still free and maybe that's a reason for not updating it frequently. What I miss here is an internal browser, optionally with readability or instapaper support for opening/viewing web links. Streaming notifications for mention, dm, fav, rt and new followers (gcm push notifications would be great).

	   In the past few updates, Twidere become easily force close, especially when loading image with unstable network. Please check since I can't report it via "error dialog" because Google Play Service stopped when trying to report.

	   Unless the media preview because its too big and looks inconvenient. I wish there's an option to choose the size; I prefer if its on the left side of the tweet with the size of an icon but just a little bigger. And also, better if it has an in-app browser. thank you :)

	   Personalisation capabilities are decent, but its support for viewing replies from a tweet is frustratingly inconsistent. There also doesn't currently seem to be a way to view recent notifications, either. These things need to be implemented before it can really hope to be considered fully functional.

	   [Update]: I can't received any notification from the app even I already enable it, before the material design update there is no problem at all. I have Xperia Z3 Dual 4.4.4. -- I love this app, but there is small problem with notifications, please we need more options for the way of received it, I mean more professional, for example I can't replay the mention one by one in the notification section of my phone, because it's together and simply it's impossible to do what I want with this style. Thank you.

	   The latest update breaks the media upload; it always gave me a 404 error every time I tried to upload an image. I'm currently using Moto E on stock Lollipop. 3 stars because I used this for ~2 years and can't find any good replacement that isn't Twidere-based.

	   The latest version available here is mostly the same as the beta build I've been using for the past month or so and Twidere is back to it's best. Very few issues anymore, just a great twitter client!

	   Been using this for a few weeks and I like it so far. It'd be nice to have thumbnails for video links too though, and ability to swipe through multiple images instead of having to click in and out of each one.

	<comment>
	   Currently no titles on the tabs, abd news fees randomly refreshes to a week ago. Nevertheless the app has the potential to be the most customisable twitter for Android app - if they could just get it to work as it should!

	   Now the transparent theme doesn't work at all. That set this app apart from all others and the main reason why I started using it again. Now it's just like all other apps. Hopefully you'll activate that transparent theme again. If not, take it out of the theme options since it's misleading.

	<title>streaming extension bug</title>
	<comment>
	   since i un- and reinstalled twidere and both extensions, streaming extension will ask for permissions every few minutes, but it says there aren't any permissions needed and in the end, it simply doesn't work. kind of sad because there weren't any problems like that before. nice app in general, what i liked most was the streaming possibility. what a pity.

	<comment>
	   I'm new to Twidere and so far I like it quite a bit. Absolutely no lag at all. Incredibly quick in all respects and by far the fastest UI on any Twitter app I've ever tried. I may be wrong but it doesn't look like I can combine the feeds from my two accounts which is a Plume feature that I really like. The overall app is worthy of a 4.5+ if it weren't for the search function. Absolutely terrible results. If this were better I would give the app 5 stars but search is to important to overlook.

	  Was working fine, but now it doesnt Load anyones tweets when you actually go on their profile & then it doesn't allow you to see tweets with multiple pics. Also, doesn't Load the full convo when you press "in reply to". I used to love this app, but the update has set me back.

	<title>Went from great, to simply functional</title>
	<comment>
	   This was the best twitter app I'd ever used. However after a "recent" update, the tab images were gone, the compose button was floating around, and when you tried to view the replies to a tweet, nothing would happen. This update was a while ago now with absolutely nothing since. The app is functional, yes, but not in the capacity it once was. A shame, and after a long wait it looks like I'll be finding another.

	   App seems good, except the tab buttons don't show up. It's just empty space with the notification count floating alone. Makes it unusable. Samsung Galaxy Note 3.

	<comment>
	   Most recent update gives very jerky scrolling; text labels don't show anymore. I should not have updated in hindsight. Ever since some earlier version original tweet, "in reply to", is hidden.

	<comment>
	   Rating this version specifically. It's not good. The status bar disappears, it's laggy (on my Note 4, unacceptable). I'll definitely amend this review when a working version is released...but to even consider putting this version up for download is absolutely not cool.

	<comment>
	   I'm not even sure what the app is doing except it drains my battery because of the constant refreshes, thus moving tweets up back to the top, when you look at tweets under a hashtag. I try turning off auto refreshes in setting but that does not stop it. It does that if I go look at tweets under someone name too. Very annoying and drains battery fast. Home was good though. Hope the complete/stable version come soon.

	   It's stunning how quickly the developers have ruined this app. Pictures won't display, there's no way to retrieve saved tweets, there's no way to follow conversations, they've removed the icons at the top which tell you what timeline you're reading. Total trash right now.

	   A few features have went missing since the last update. Worst of all the tab titles at the top of the screen have either been removed or made the same colour as the tab so you cant see them. Time to look at what else is out there i think.

	   Love this Twitter client app. I always use this if I planning to change my main Twitter app. But I've recently gotten a new mobile (LG G3). And the handle is differnt compared to using it on my Galaxy S2. Tweets, images and trend searches open when I'm swiping through the interface. The main reasons that I don't always use this is because it doesn't have specific user push notifications (I like to know when specific people tweet) and no multiple image preview or upload supported either. Otherwise it's great

	<comment>
	   This is the best twitter app for Android I've found and has a lot of the features from Tweetbot that I loved on iOS. However, trying to work out which account is tweeting from the compose view is completely impossible, and even when i select one it still sometimes tweets from both, which is a bit problem.

	   I've tried a number of free Twitter clients, from the official one to popular alternatives like Plume and Tweedle. Twidere beats them all hands down, both in terms of not devouring system resources and in performance and features. Over all, best client on the play store in my opinion. Update: still the best.

	   The app is very nice, can customize the look of it, but why doesn't it have a widget?? That's a deal breaker for me, uninstalling

	<title>BEST TWITTER CLIENT EVER</title>
	<comment>
	   PROS: NO ADS! HIGHLY customisable, BEAUTIFUL interface, FAST even on slow networks, smooth, push notifs, easily manage lists/mutes/filters, save Drafts, view Trends... CONS: no tab option for faves of own tweets (only mentions & RTs), viewing replies/conversations is clunky/confusing, gifs &vids (&some pics) won't load, no "near by" stream, no "schedule tweet" feature, app size goes from 5MB to 30MB in space

	   Lat update left it so i don't know which account i have chosen when i try to compose a tweet. I have a galaxy s4 and the account used to be outlined with a little blue box to signify which account or accounts were chosen for the current tweet. Now it is a guessing game because i can't tell which account i am trying from.

	<comment>
	   A few things need to be sorted out. For example, better muting, and better loading of tweets. It would be nice to mute retweets, for example. Also, it's a drag when you have to tap on "load more tweets" multiple times, and scroll down just to see what was tweeted over night. Looks very promising though.

	   this app is great. i like it a lot because it works similarly to tweetdeck for me; i can have my lists and users up in tabs. however my app crashes a lot!! especially when im in the midst of being very active! also it would be nice to include an option for not just a mentions tab but a notification tab in general so u can see faves and rt's of your tweets. one of my biggest pet peeves is when i click on the "in reply to" button to view previous tweets in a thread the tweets flash for a second then disappear

	   You can't seem to see your favorites (except from a specific user?) or unfollow anyone. I don't understand the point of a twitter app without those features. I run a joke account and need to see my favorites so I know what landed and what ideas I need to scrap or improve.

	<comment>
	   But an option to increase the time you have to tap on something to open a tweet/link/picture would be pretty cool. I find myself opening lots of clickable things while swiping through tabs or scrolling through my tweets. Alternatively an option to disable that you can swipe/scroll and open a tweet/image/link at the same time. I sometimes land both on the tab I wanted to swipe to and open the tweet my thumb happened to be on while swiping. It feels too sensitive, can't think of a better way to put it.

	<comment>
	   I'm a dedicated Ubersocial user...but have been having some problems with it lately. I saw the reviews for this app and decided to try it. I've only used Twidere for a short time but like it already. Lots of customization options when it comes to look and feel, and the way tweets and images are displayed. I will be using this app exclusively so that I get to know it better. The app could use a few widgets - I like having my tweet feed displayed on one of my screens rather than having to open the app.

	   This is my favorite twitter client, it works how I want, and looks how I want it to look.

	<title>Great app, but no conversation view</title>
	<comment>
	   Twidere looks beautiful, but a few basic things let it down. I can't figure out how to see a tweet in the context of a conversation, rather than the single tweet on its own. Also is there a way to scroll through the images someone has tweeted in their profile?

	<comment>
	   It runs a lot smoother than the official twitter app! And the color options are a lot nicer on the eyes. My only complaint is that there isn't a general area or tab for notifications. There's one for mentions, but I like to see when people like and retweet things. Also, when you click on the Home icon to refresh the feed, you still have to drag the page down to force-refresh it. Small issue, but it confused me at first.

	   However, there's still a few bugs. Sometimes the "tap to load more" doesn't work/ doesn't appear. In further improvement, I hope that they will have sync functionality. I have few device, and sometimes upgrade to new devices. To customize all over again is quite a hassle. App wise, it is still better compare to other twitter base apps.

	   What I love: Customizations are on point, vast without being bloated. Very nice and clean UI. A LOT more stable than the stock twitter app. Keep compose window open feature. Header and profile editing support. What I would like to see in future updates: enable attaching multiple pictures in tweets. GIF support. More convenient refresh feature. Notifications for RTs, favs and follows.

	  I like how you can edit the theme color and make the background transparent. The "keep the compose tweet open" option helps too. Also like how faving/retweeting takes a few buttons to press so no accidental faving. Unfortunately there seems to be some bugs, like userpic switching. I also don't like how it doesn't automatically refresh (even though I have the option ON) and I have to refresh manually. Overall, an OK app, would be great if they improve some parts.

	   My favorite Twitter app out of many I've tried. custom tabs make monitoring lists so much easier. Only one real flaw; "see replies" rarely shows me any replies. Seeing Twitter conversations is a huge part of the experience. Would give five stars but that's a big flaw.

	<comment>
	   This is a very polished and thoughtfully-designed app. It's also open source and privacy-respecting. I greatly prefer it over Twitter's official app. A few SMALL issues: it doesn't handle all Twitter URLs from external apps reliably (maybe there's some issue with its URL matching?); it would be nice if there were a way to search for or jump to specific users' tweets/feeds more quickly; auto-loading images in tweets doesn't work for me at all.

	<comment>
	   Literally the only thing this app needs in order to completely surpass the normal Twitter app is working notifications, only if it just vibrates, that'll be all it needs. If this app gets working notifications, I'll never go back to the normal Twitter app, but for now I'll have to leave this app again as I find that not having working notifications is just too big of a downside, even outweighing all of Twitter's bugs and problems. As soon as Twidere gets working notifications, I'll never go back to Twitter.

	   I really wanted to like this app and for the most part I do. More than that actually, I love it...except notifications don't work. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling...I've changed every possible setting...I've reboot multiple times but to no avail... no notifications. Sorry, this is a deal breaker.

	   My problem is that I can't see other pictures (if there are two or more posted.) I also can't send photos in DM. And you should also let us follow people without going into their profiles directly (you know, like Twitter's). But other than that, the app's doing fine.

	   PROS: customisable, beautiful interface, FAST even on slow networks, smooth, NO ADS, push notifications, easily manage lists/mutes. CONS: no way to view faves &RTs of own tweets (only mentions), viewing replies/conversations is clunky/confusing, gifs &vids (&some pics) won't load, no "near by" stream, only displays 1 # or @ at a time when typing, no schedule tweet feature, app size goes from 5 MB to 60 MB in space :(

	<comment>
	   Personally I love the app, its awesome and customisability are endless. On top of which I think its an overall complete app. However there are a few things which could be easily dealt with, for example the app icon I believe needs some kind of material design update, more flat and simple that follows material design, also addition of material design to the app itself. Not an overall makeover but small things here and there. Also if I could view the conversation of the tweet without clicking would be great.

	   Why should I EVER trust an app that wants my Twitter password? Just because it says 'don't freak out, it's totally safe!'? LOL

	   Users, first review complete. Pictures included. 鉁撯湏鉁? Search, "#twidere Im_SantoshJ" to know more about this client. :-) I like it. Loads of features. Extensions, themes, filters, color codes, and much more. Hi there, I normally do not do this. But, as a enthusiast I'm writing this review. Out of the box rating it 3.8 ish. Follow and check complete review on Twitter. Handle: Im_Santosh

	<comment>
	   The most attractive twitter client I am currently using, but seems to perform inconsistently. Sometimes I click on a tweet, it goes full screen, I then click on the little "replies" link, I will see what other users have tweeted in reply, but on other tweets I will see a blank. And I know that there are replies to that original tweet. Also would like to see which users have favourited a tweet. Also if I try and edit a tab, I can change the tab name, but not the definition and what is the stagger tab?

	   Such a gorgeous app. Unfortunately started to hog as much as 30% battery from the last few days. Also, strangely it showed a person's DP against someone else's tweet. But upon refreshing it would be fixed. Uninstalling for the moment.

	   This app is a work of art, really. So smooth, clean, and intuitive, the only things that would make it absolutely flawless is an option to add an interactions tab (where all RTs, favorites, follows and quotes are shown as in the Twitter app) also, the ability to watch Vines in-app.

	<comment>
	   I love the customizability in the app and the custom tabs but there's two things that are quite frustrating about this app that takes it away from 5 stars. One being the constant rate limit exceeded message that pops up way too often, and the other more important one being that notifications simply do not work, if this worked It'd be 5 stars EASILY but I don't get them unless I've refreshed my homepage after I've opened the app or 30 minutes or even upwards to over an hour after a message has been received.

	   Love the look and customization options. I miss the conversation view though. Everything else seems fine and dandy. Just add the conversation view when in single tweet view and you're on a roll.

	   This is the most perfect app for twitter user ! Totally recommend this ! The name of this is interesting, oh ! I love the theme and how you can set it as your preference. Elegant and professional looking ! And also how it can set those tabs! The only cons of it is the loading mentions, it kinda takes a while (but that doesn't matter anyway hahah) That's all i guess :3 thanks for making this cool app !

	<comment>
	   This seems like a lovely app, but it won't let me post pictures (I get an error message and the tweet is saved to drafts). Waited a few weeks, hoping for an update, but nothing has happened. Also, it's frustrating trying to access the page of a user through their retweets. It should be a 1-click process, but it's not even an option. Uninstalling.

	   Came from ios and finally a tweetbot alternative, only things I will like and this will make it the best twitter client on play store will be faster launch of the app when you open, in app browser with mobilizer support like readability and refresh of list on startup like home timeline.

	   Everything is amazing, except that whenever new tweets are loaded, I have to tap the 'click here to load more tweets' and often more than once, it makes me loose my place and is a total waste of time. I'm probably gonna stop using twidere over that one infuriating detail.

	<comment>
	   Drafts in a third party twitter app? Clean and customizable UI? Fav and retweet notifications? This app gets a lot of things right. My only complaint so far is that after tapping the home screen icon, it takes a solid 3-5 seconds to launch whereas other apps launch immediately. An internal browser would be nice as well!

	   Twidere is my favorite Twitter app now. I would've have it 5 stars, but I didn't because it's missing a few things. If Twidere added more detailed notifications to it's @ mentions notifications it would be better. Like if it could start telling you, who followed you, how many people Rt'd you & who Rt'd you like in the regular Twitter app, they have that feature. Another is, if you could customize the back ground yourself, like if it gave you the option to take a picture from your gallery. That's all.

	   I've been using this app for months. It's FOSS, which is very important for me, and works great while looking great and being intuitive. 5/5.

	<title>Pretty snazzy</title>
	<comment>
	   With the death of TweetDeck, I'm left looking for a replacement, and this comes the closest, and even outperforms in some areas. Better than any and everything else I can find on Play, and the pricing can't be beat. Few bugs, and missing features, but one can always hope this will continue to see development. **Edit (30MAR14)** Boosted score to 5 stars: Although not following any regular schedule, Twidere is being updated with reasonable frequency. The most irksome bug has been long since patched out, and I am quite pleased with the current iteration. I have used this app exclusively for several months now, and intend to continue to do so.

	<comment>
	   Lightweight, nice interface and especially recommended if - like me - you read twitter via lists and prefer to have the choice if pictures get displayed automatically or not. Twidere has lots of options to fit your needs and works a treat. There is only one thing that I like better in the Carbon twitter client: If I share a link to the Pocket app Carbon saves the tweet the link came from with it (so if I decide to retweet it after reading it, I can do that via that tweet). Twidere does not do that (yet) but then not even twitter-official Tweetdeck does it. It's just one minor and very special request I'd have. Anything else about this app is great.

	<comment>
	   I like it. It's smooth. It is nice to look at. Easily one of the best interfaces of any twitter app. Only problems I have are that it's difficult to see who follows you when you open a profile as it's not clear and obvious. It's also inconvenient that it doesn't auto complete twitter handles and most hash tags like my other 2 twitter clients. Fix those, this is easily 5 stars.

	<comment>
	   This is by far the best Twitter client I've used, I've tried Talon, TweetCaster, Plume, Carbon and many others but my fave is Twidere. This client has almost everything, it's very customizable, it's lightweight, it's easy to use, it supports multiple accounts and the best part is that it's free. It'd be great it the app itself could "stream" or keep itself open in the background so I can receive notifications. It also needs some improvements in the notifications. This app has the potential to be the BEST!!!

	<comment>
	   Twitter is like a chat.. So when twidere decides to alert me to a mention on twitter it comes 20 to 30 minutes AFTER the person has composed the message! Worse yet I cant change how frequently to check my account for updates. Some good features like twit longer added to this app... But severely let down on lack of additional user features around how you are notified... When... With what tone.. Etc Fox this and we might be dealing with a decent app

	   Best twitter client I have used. And the dev responds too. For "real time notifications", reduce your auto refresh time, but expect to use a lot more battery and data. Kichibichiya is based on Twidere, so go rant there and not here.

	   Almost perfect. The one feature that is possible on iOS that I've yet to see on Android is some sort of visual feedback when clicking on links from the timeline view. It saves time if you click on the wrong link. I'd like to see a better quick menu. The list view works, but I'd like to see an additional quick menu with reply, retweet, favorite and maybe open link options. Maybe can anchor it across the bottom with the compose button. I'd also like to be able to set a default "reply" account.

	   Only thing that I would add is the ability to see who has favourited your tweets and get notifications from them, and be able to toggle the ability to do so. Maybe have a favourites tab that isn't just tweets that you have favourited. Otherwise, beautiful app, works lovely. **EDIT** This app DID work lovely until the side menu stopped registering anything. Couldnt select anything or go into settings, menu key woukdnt work. Not my phones problem because these keys were registering outside of the app.

	<title>NOT BAD</title>
	<comment>
	   It's kinda like a cool twitter app . It's design with simple colours , everything is fine to me . But it's just crash all the time . Sometimes it can't even open the twidere . If you can fix this it will be great . But i guarantee that this app is super cool . Like the way it slide at the side :) great !

	   Great work. A few things I'd love to see are long URLs so we can see what the link is. Semi transparent Nav bar which KitKat introduced so we can see a fuller timeline/screen.

	<comment>
	   I want to congratulate Mariotaku Lee for this Twitter server. But also I want to make a request: In official Twitter's apk you can see who RTs and FAVs you, could you do something to be able to activate this option? I don't mean do it permanent, but if someone like me want to know who FAVs or RTs his tweets he could activate this option inside "Mentions' tab", or do another tab which include this option like "Notifications" in official Twitter apk. Do you? Please answer

	<comment>
	   It's a beautiful app. Although I have to take a star of for various reasons. 1: the amount of memory it takes is crazy. You should build it with the memory optimization tweaks for KitKat. 2: can't get push notifications. 3: I understand the rate limit but it's just so much more aggressive on this compared to other apps. Meaning the way this handles refreshing could use a bit tweaking

	   Great app, best for Twitter but what is going on with 'lists' function? Doesn't always add people to created lists, lists duplicate themselves then sometimes 'list' function won't display. Annoying when trying to sort out those I follow.

	   If you're looking for a speedy, high-quality Twitter client with a vast array of functions and capabilities and a clean, attractive interface, LOOK NO FURTHER! Twidere is without the shadow of a doubt the best you can get! I've tried at least seven different Twitter apps, including the official one, but none come close to this one in terms of features and functionality. I've given the app five stars because it really is undeniably FANTASTIC, but I do have a few suggestions I'd like to make: 1) Crashing: This app actually crashes a LOT for me. I have a Galaxy SIII; I don't know if it's my phone or the app, but hopefully it's something that can be fixed either way. 2) Notifications for specific users: Sometimes you follow a celebrity or company or organization whose Tweets you don't want to miss. The official Twitter app gives you the ability to favorite a profile so that whenever they tweet, you get a notification. This might be a good feature to add! As I said before, however, all things considered, this app is literally the best. I only have those two small complaints, but they're not unbearable issues. I'm looking forward to updates and improvements!

	   What a brilliant twitter client. Seriously, will be hard-pressed to find a better one. Have tried the best twitter clients but nothing excelled in terms of design (first priority), features, and battery life except this one ! But I would really appreciate if this app supports Fullscreen feature as seen in Android 4.4 KitKat

	   Great, but I'd need a way to fave/rt/reply with one tap, like a small menu underneath each tweet. Add that and I'd never go back to normal twitter Edit: yeah, i did, but i was thinking more of like having an option for some small icons like a star and a rt icon underneath each tweet just to make everything faster

	   The level of customization in this app is insane! It's almost everything that I want in a Twitter app with a couple of exceptions. - When I select a Tweet it would be great if the conversation/replies would show up automatically instead of requiring you to "view replies". - An internal browser would also be nice, but that's just wishful thinking right now and not completely necessary. If they can make some minor tweaks and improve the overall polish/responsiveness of this app it'll be the best Twitter app, bar none.

	   I dont know it's bug or what, but when i tap "load more tweet" the timeline will scrolling up til the middle new timeline, so if i want to read old tweet...i must scroll down the timeline...its really annoying. And that's happen too when i tap "load more..." then i'm quit from the app and back to app again...the timeline will go up to the newest tweet. Fyi i choose "remember position" already and uncheck all in the "refresh" (i didnt use auto refresh and all in the menu) Xperia L jellybean

	<comment>
	   Twidere works great on my phone; it's fast, responsive and not weighed down by unnecessary UI. On my 9-inch tablet it's a similar story, but the UI is a bit weird with a big gap on one side of the screen and an odd floating placement of the Compose window. But, hey, it's open-source, has no ads and lets you post on Twitter. Recommended!

	<comment>
	   Infinitely better than the standard client, with countless little features and customizations. The option of both light and dark themes is a great bonus; add to that control over nearly every aspect of the app and there's very little you will be left wanting for. The only fault I have found is high battery use; you may need to tweak the way Twidere handles synchronization and refreshes.

	   Best twitter client I've come across, and I've tested many, falcon pro, carbon, tweedle, plume, hootsuite. They all suck. Twidere is the only one that supports custom colums AND remembers the reading position! Other nice features and clean, nice UI are just the cherry on top. Keep up the good work!

	   Lots of control options under settings but nothing too overwhelming. Draft and mute features: check. Color code users &/ or acct's: check. Fast screen transitions: check. Detailed user analytics: check. Gesture/ swipe features: check. I'm sold. Plus it's nice to see the dev still updating after Twitter api changes.

	   I think I've tested every client on the store and this is the only one that meets most of my requirements. I would just like the added feature to edit colors to my own preferences.

	   I have downloaded most of twitter clients in playstore. They all wrapped with a bunch of annoying ads, or not good interface. Then I came to this app. This is perfect, all I want is in this app. And no ad, I really respect you guys for no ad at all. I love the interface, and all. The only thing that is inconvenient is the notifications came late and not vibrating even though I set it to vibrate. If you could fix it, this is the most perfect twitter app.

	<comment>
	   I love the customization options of the app. However, the app suffers from significant screen lag, scrolling lag, and keyboard input after about 30mins of use. I do not know if it is my HTC One specifically, or perhaps performance issues of the app itself. Perhaps this can be addressed in a future update.

	   After testing it for a day, this app has a chance to be the best twitter app. It got simple appearance and maneuver, but sadly this app is puzzled by it's extensions. I gladly getting this app in one piece, with it tweet longer and widget.

	   Updated: The new update is mind blowing, please keep the development, coz this is the only twitter apps which is superb. Thank you so much. <3 Old review: I generally don't write reviews but your apps forced me to do so. I have tried almost every paid/free twitter apps like Plume, Seesmic, Ubersocial, Biod, chant etc etc and none of the apps comes close to what this can do. The developer is calling this app as experiment build but its close to the beta of what I have used.

	   I can't say enough good things about this app. It is fast, multiple accounts in one steam, light and dark themes. I also like the color code for retweets. And if you don't like it you can turn it off. 5 stars from me.

	   I'm a quite picky twitter user, I always look at how an app looks, can see via, have twitlonger, can translate and can see trending topic. Twidere is basic but powerful, you just need to find out. You also can use twicca plugins in this app. But one thing I wish will be better - the quote tweet tool. Although it quotes the tweet, it is still a reply. Please fix it to work like the old retweet. Thank you.

	<comment>
	   1- It's not 100% smooth, almost there, a little lag when scrolling vertically. 2- Adding a 'Favorites' column doesn't show nothing, it keeps refreshing and blank 3- Profile images should be centered in profile pages 4- I would like to display smaller profile avatars in the timeline

	<comment>
	   Excellent: neat, fast, well featured. But there seems to be one simple but vital feature missing: if you open a tweet you can't see the replies already sent to it. Half the pleasure in opening (say) one Of Donald Trump's bizarre outbursts is reading the dozens of hilarious replies he attracts: but Twidere just shows you the woven-headed one's words without those replies. UPDATE: Dev. tells me this facility was dropped from the Twitter API between 1.0 to 1.1: come on Twitter, we want clients to do this!

	   Sure it's sound stupid, but believe me there will be more user by doing that. Just make a developer's choice check box to turn off application error notices. Anyway still very nice work. I switch from twicca from time to time to use this app. Really like the 'activity about me' tab.

	<comment>
	   The UI looks great, make no mistake about it. But it didn't feel smooth to me. It also lacks a few features like support for tweets over 140 characters and the speed of loading of tweets, but the blame twitter's dodgy API for that. It definitely has room to improve.

If there was one tiny thing I wish I could do, it would be to have the ability to hide menu bars so I could have my tweets on a full page. Even without that, it's a keeper

	   i just saw this app on my play store today and downloaded it because i haven't tried it. and after i signed in to my twitter account i was impressed. the clean simple design and the ability to reply on multiple tweets just exactly what i need. however, i can't find my custom tabs. I don't know where it was placed. i assumed it would be on the top along with the other tabs, but it wasn't there. so i deleted it again. when i tried to add favorites tab, the tab was there. but i couldn't refresh tweets that i've favorited. other than that, i haven't found any problems with this app. i think it could be one mighty twitter client. oh.. one more thing.. i couldn't see any conversation option. (or is it only me who couldn't find 'see conversation' option?) - 24 Nov: now i can see the "pull to see conversation" option.

	   Very good client, only issue is after switching accounts (untick one account, retick another) , selected account for posting doesn't change with it. I prefer to manage one account at a time, so this is a bit of a loss...

	<title>Most efficient interface</title>
	<comment>
	   I always look for efficient interface in an app, and so far this is app is it, lpoks neat, simple, holo-y and also fast due to the ability to turn off profile image and inline image preview, and also the dual pane layout us beautiful. Rivals most paid client I've used. Unfortunately I'm running into connection problems several times, and have to clear data to fix it.

	   I was also a twicca user but the latest update there made me shift to twidere am quite liking it but when my Internet is slow [like using 3G or poor wifi connection] It does not always put the tweet on draft. Sometimes my tweets gets lost and draft is also not added. Also when I tweet a pictures it does take some time to upload the Pic and tweet is understandable but I have to wait for whole tweet to be done first and then send next tweet or refresh my Timeline. If I tweet and It is uploading in the backgro

	   i switch to Twidere after the last update of twicca( i hate that bird on top) , i like the dark theme and also the interface, my only suggestion is to have a plug in or extension to use another photo uploader, but overall is a great twitter client

	<title>Better than TweetDeck!</title>
	<comment>
	   Better than TweetDeck and the stock twitter client, but it still doesn't show stats for individual tweets like the Twitter site does (how many people retweeted, who they are, who starred the tweet, etc). On the upside, it also doesn't force me to constantly flip my tablet from lanscape to portrait and back again. Great work!

	   Notifications work, multiple accounts work, and it has a nice, minimal Holo / ICS theme. Lots of settings to play with. This is exactly what I need right now while I'm waiting for some other highly anticipated new Twitter clients to be released.

	   Hey, I hadn't seen this app before. I started looking for a Twitter client since the one I used to use made bad changes. This app has everything I was looking for. I think the padding between tweets can be improved (maybe there's an option and I haven't found it). Anyhow, despite the fact that the Twitter's API sucks it works great, and it's open source, what else could you ask for? :-)

	<comment>
	   Nice looking interface, though the navigation isn't the most intuitive. There's no way to check the trending topics unfortunately... even though there's an option to set the trend location. I feel like the avatars are too big as well. I'd prefer a refresh button than a pull to refresh method. It's more of a pain having to swipe down to refresh, especially when sometimes I miss swiping it.

	<comment>
	   I've been using Twicca for almost a year, but have grown bored with its UI. Twidere is pretty similar to Twicca, but has a more attractive UI in my opinion. I'd like to see the option to add a color assignment to your own profile, as well as colored links and usernames. I'd also like to see the mute option on the long press menu. You should be able to mute users, hashtags, and sources directly from a person's tweet on the long press menu. It needs more photo services support too (via me).

	   great app...just needs a few more things. Set colors for a users tweet, just not a color on the side of it. View conversations after a long press on a tweet. Odd thing, my autocomplete when tweeting someone doesn't have all the people I follow in the list.

	   I love the UI and this app looks like it's heading in the right direction. Please add option to view account usernames instead of "real names". Needs to improve loading/refreshing time. Love the combined timeline for multiple accounts but needs to get rid of double tweet updates when an account is followed on more than one account. Looking forward to updates, keep up the good work!

	<comment>
	   Needs work, but I'm loving it! Twicca is still my main client, but Twidere is my secondary for use with alternate accounts. Suggestions? 1. Allow me to disable the '#Connect' trends tab, so I can replace it with a DM column. 2. Add an option to default from posting all accounts, or only your default. I have multiple accounts because I post different things from each, not to post the same to all of them all the time. (: It's got a bit to go before being my main client, but I still love it! <3 ~ @ScottJFox

	   Love the app but highlighting tweets when mentioned would be great, also the ability to see which tweets of my own were retweeted. For some reason it never let's me change my profile pic. I love this app though, it made me delete all others I was using

	   Love the UI, love that I can create my own tabs. The app is very easy to navigate. I agree with Streater, I'd like to see the links a different color on the timeline, as well as hashtags and mentions. Now I'm torn between this app, Plume and UberSocial.

	   Maybe change the function of enter button is the best way if u want to quote with comment quickly. And refresh time is too long, but the UI is simply. Sorry for my bad english ;(

	<comment>
	   I like the Holo theme used by the app. The columns look great on my tablet. A feature request to the dev would be to add columns for each of my lists. Apart from all that, here's the main inconvenience: Even after today's speed improvement update where the dev gets updates in 3-5 seconds, it's still taking about a minute or 2 for my updates to appear. And I also need to update manually every time enough though I have set it otherwise.

	<comment>
	   I like the new look on the Nexus 7. Scrolling is still an issue, but only in portrait. In land scape, even with photos on Nexus 7 scrolling is super smooth. Just make it super smooth in portrait and I will be all happy and give 5 stars.

	<comment>
	   This is a great Twitter app. First time I tried it there was no fully black background so didn't use it, now there is an option for solid black for AMOLED screens, which simply looks awesome and sexy on the GNex. Needs option to choose photo upload service, TwitLonger, also needs to be smoother in scrolling. But otherwise a very nice looking app, thanks to the Holo UI.

	<comment>
	   Works even better after the bug fixes. But please bring back dual pane view for tablets in portrait mode! If you wanted to remove it then make it a configurable option instead - I thought it was a better implementation than Plume and would give 5 stars if you brought it back!

	   Holy crud, did this little hidden gem surprise right out of the gate. Not to speak ill of the boys at Boid, but this is everything that I've wanted from them, and in version 0.1.0. The ONLY thing I can complain about is scrolling smoothness - a bit noticeably choppy. Cannot wait to see this develop and evolve. (EDIT: Also, having a refreshed timelime start at the bottom of new tweets, not the top, would be FANTASTIC.)
