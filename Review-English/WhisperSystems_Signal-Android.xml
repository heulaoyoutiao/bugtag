	  I like WhatsApp and Telegram...but you can set Signal as a default messenger... also I had to uninstall it recently and my phone runs more stable, so I don't know what that's all about. Wish you could access google photos. Wish it had video calls. Keep up the good work though! I love this app.

	  When no data connection, does not switch to unsecured message. Consequently I loose sms when out and about, family miss calls. Has many of the features of Whatsapp but with better privacy but missed messages mean can't be used. Uninstall destroys all message history rather than import to usual message app, unreal.

	  This app has truly surpassed my expectations with usability, performance, and cleanliness. What impresses me the most about this app is how easy it is to set up. This app can allow non-tech savy people to set up fully encrypted chats without confusion or frustration. I'm recommending this to all of my friends.

	  The end-to-end encryption doesn't seem to be working. I have AirDroid installed on my phone and it is able to read my messages that are sent and received with this app. If they were truly encrypted end-to-end no third-party software would be able to read those messages. I have an email into the company to discuss this all update this when we have it figured out

	  Great app. Does exactly as advertised, but I'd like a little customisability in its appearance, and scheduled messaging would be nice as well.

	  Only Missing is when start composing a message when you tap the circled + you have to tap again on the space were you type your message, instead if only the keyboad screen pop out and the cursor pop right out ready to type your message. Other that the app is working find.

	  considering the alternative's, this app. is by far the best attempt at creating a quasi-secure encrypted messaging app. Easy to set-up and use. Does not require a phd in math. To understand the encryption protocols. Since most security is in fact "security theater" this nice piece of work gives you a great view from the front seats..use and enjoy.

	  Love Signal. Only as good as your contacts who are willing to join though. And the inability to attach multiple attachments such as pics to a single text is annoying. Also I do have an issue with delayed receipt of texts very frequently. Not sure if this is a Signal server issue or carrier issue. Overall great privacy app.

	  No one I know seems to have any interest in encrypting their messages. Still, this app is easy to use, and has a nicer interface than my default messaging app, and it benefits ongoing development.

	  I am really sad that not a single person in my contacts is using this amazing messaging app. I am trying to explain to my closest friends that it is imperative to have a private encrypted chat room but no way I can reach to them,they simply do not understand why! For me, knowing that my private correspondence is scrutinized is so scary and frightening that I can't imagine what the future holds? Are we going to become a number in bureaucratic experiment which doesn't have a free thought?

	  If you're here you know what you're looking for. Yes, hands down the best messaging app with privacy at its core. However there is one big omission. That is the ability to work with a 2nd sim. I could find no way to switch sims or to validate the 2nd sim. Shame as it is a good app otherwise.

	  Amazing to finally have a real open source alternative to all the previous instant messengers! Works great, just the phone function is Bugg it some times. Especially, I liked the possibility to include the SMS function into the signal messenger. However it would be nice if one could easily choose whether to sent a signal message or a SMS since not all people using signal check for signal messages as regularly as for SMS. Last but not least some of the permissions required by this app are not plausible to me. Still five stars for the amazing stability and function in an open source application!! Thank you.

	  Awesome if it works, but it constantly drops calls or fails to connect even when both phones are on WiFi. Call quality is bad compared to e.g. WhatsApp. Does not signal when call drops, and will completely drop call instead of reconnecting if the other person doesn't have Internet for a few seconds. Used to also have issues where messages often were delivered minutes or hours later despite both phones having Internet - that seems to have improved but current version drops calls exactly every 10 min. Edit: now calls don't work at all. Splendid!

	  The app was fine till the most recent update. Any time you have to go to the middle of a word to fix it, the delete removes every word and letter to the right of the cursor. And when you delete from the end of a sentence, it adds words that weren't previously there and takes forever to delete. Would have given 5 stars before the update messed it up.

	  It works good. It has some minor annoyances such as hassles me to rate it before I can get a good feel for its ultimate abilities, hassles to get all my contacts on board by hassling them like a used auto sales man whose overwhelmingly trying to do things I am not ready to do without even giving me time for doing research and time for considerable consideration. Hassles false notifications constantly. Annoying and tacky marketing. I cannot get app for my tablet. If they would stop hassling me to do this review and get a chance to get to test it out fully, I may be giving it a 5 star rating. Other than that, I still need to run my default messing app and that app has access to my network and possibly still can see what is going on with my data even if it is encrypted. I still need to see how that goes. I have a bachelor in IT risk management and Cyber security and really need more time to give a better rating. Otherwise, so far it seems like a good app for the most part on it's functionality. tablet

	  Great app, much better than alternatives. Gets a little confused (i.e. delayed) though if you send a message to a fellow signal user and you are not on a wifi/data connection - would be good if it asked whether to send an SMS instead. Other than that it works well, and is a must have for people who enjoy their privacy and security

	  When using the desktop app, I still get notifications from this phone and I'll hear my phone vibrate for every message. Can this app not detect that I am using the desktop app and therefore don't need notifications on my phone? Also, sometimes, I get the same message twice from a sender when they claim they only sent the message once. Security is great, and that's the best thing about this app.

	  Definitely well designed, clean interface, great alternative to Hangouts or WhatsApp. Only downside is using it as an SMS app: if you have no data, the app doesn't seem to let you send a basic SMS message. Definitely a critical feature that needs to be present because sometimes I'm in areas without wifi and I need to quickly notify someone.

	  I love the mobile app however the Desktop app lacks polish. More importantly you can only connect a maximum of three devices to your account. A person with a mobile phone, home laptop and home desktop therefore cannot use the desktop app from a work desktop or laptop. This seems very limiting, especially since people tend to have multiple devices at home and work.

	  It would be nice if you add option to send SMS even to contacts that already use signal. Some people don't have mobile data and use it on WiFi only. If you add this option I could make signal my default messaging app. At the moment I need to use a different app for sending texts. Thank you for your work :-)

	  Not bad, still some ux to iron out but it's cool how it can wrap around native messaging and automatically sends with signal if they have it.

	  Why on Earth are so many permissions required for an app that is supposedly all about privacy?? See all accounts on my device? Access my calendar data? What does Signal possibly need this for?

	  I liked it. A lot. It would be nice tho to make video calls, be able to record videos from the app and swipe between media from chat(when tapping on a photo). Also, it wouldnt't mind me if I could cancel the media that is being sent.

	  Really wanted to use it, but right off the bat when I set it as my default SMS app I cannot even see my own posts in transferred messages? Pet peeve wise, I could've lived a little with this, but theme choices are meh at very best. Theme-wise I would've stayed on it as my default, but not being able to see my previous messages is a no-go.

	  Finally! A customizable messaging app that works. MMS, GIF, text - it all works. Unfortunately, most of my friends do not seem concerned about the relative unsecured nature of other text messaging apps and haven't signed up. Even though, it works. Need better pop-up options though. But after going through 13 other apps that I had issues with, I'm very pleased

	  Easy to use, simple and uncluttered interface with easy method to confirm security of call, and SMS. The call quality occasionally suffers based upon the data connection, but the ease of making a secure call more than makes up for it. The best app for security bar none.

	  So far, I love it. Tons of wonderful features that make it easy & convenient to use. Easy set up & very secure. Able to block contacts, set up passcode, disable screenshots & a lot more. I recommended this to my husband & my friends.

	  Signal gets 5 stars for security. I have a few UI foibles with it: they take up space to display the name of the sender next to every message in a group chat, even when the same person sends multiple messages in a row. That's annoying because my phone has limited screen real estate. It defaults to pushing notifications even if you have the app open (I don't want my phone to buzz and make noise if I can already see the chat). Other than that it is well designed. Definitely prettier and slicker than Hangouts. WhatsApp's design is slightly better.

	  So far really impressed BUT 1 thing I'd like to see added is a delete option to the Mark As Read & Reply options. I get messages that I don't need to go into the app for or keep, a quick view one & done. Add that and this app is a 5 star.

	  Easy to use interface that's just as simple to use as the messaging apps already familiar with. With this truly effective tool your texts & calls always are encrypted with bank level encryption algorithm. Check under the hood and see it keeps special keys that let you communicate in confidential privacy. Even when hacked! The # keys are only good for the device it s created for. Brilliant!

	  The resend feature is broken. When my message didn't send the first time, I clicked resend once for each person in the group, and eventually every person got the same message 14 times. There's no reason anyone should get a message more than once, no matter how many times I hit resend. Once they receive it that should be it.

	  On the whole I really like it, a tidy UI and simple to use, as well as secure and encrypted between two signal users. You need to be on wifi/mobile data to be able to send messages to a friend you've established signal contact with. it won't tell you that the message can't be or hasn't been sent. Get in the habit of checking connectivity before sending, and decide if you want to use insecure SMS, as it's a simple enough switch on the send button. They've not got the UX case handled if your friend uninstalls or stops using it either, it needs to default back to SMS If it can be detected. It's also very fussy with the international phone number formats - even if your friend phones you so it's the number that is registered without you entering it by hand, you have to edit. But apart from that, it's great. Head and shoulders above anything else I've tried, plus secure.

	  Great app, best for security. Two requests: 1. When I archive a message, can you mark it as read. It is a pain to have to open up a message to then archive it, so I don't keep getting unread notifications. 2. Implement the colour changing dependent on profile picture like google messenger.

	  "Waiting for SMS verification", even when I received the message, and there is no way to enter code from it. Then I have to press "call me" and only then entering the code becomes possible. Why not let me enter the code from SMS?

	  This is a small and tidy SMS application that will do everything you need it to do. It's fast, easy to use, and seamlessly handles real SMS (with those who don't have Signal) and secured messages. Personally, I prefer it to other leading SMS apps, even without the security asset. The main problem is that there are very few users. The only person I actually have secured messages with, I persuaded to download the application.

	  Excellent texting app, the encryption is totally seamless, no user set-up required. Just want to acknowledge the uphill battle the devs have so marvellously won - not only is this the most secure texting app on the market, but it competes with and exceeds most other texting apps. Download it, you won't be disappointed. Update: the encrypted calls lag by about three seconds. If your first concern is a private conversation, it'll do, but it's not really a drop-in replacement for regular calls.

	  After watching Snowden and seeing the level of intrusion the NSA can have into everyone's private data, I decided to take reasonable steps to start reducing my digital footprint--not just because of NSA data collection, but to reduce personalized ads and the risk of identity theft overall. Signal was my first easy step in this direction. I like that it can completely replace the standard messaging app in Android. I wish it had that feature for my friends on iOS.

	  I love the privacy features of this app, but I find it odd that you can't use voice recognition to create a text. I don't want to send an audible message within my messaging app, I just want to have a hands-free option. If this were possible, I'd bump up my stars!

	  I really like this app as a texting app and using it for private messaging. But the one thing that is super annoying is that there is no MMS options. 300kb is just too small. I can text gifs to signal users just fine but regular text doesn't work.

	  Tried the app for more security. However, it appears the party I am texting has to have the app too which decreases utility for me. Also have not yet figured out how to delete old texts.

	  By interpreting "user friendly" as "idiot proof" they've hidden all the features you'd want to know about with regards to your privacy. Add in the fact that it is constantly pestering you with notifications to invite your friends and I will be using Riot etc for my private messaging needs.

	  I'm trying this as an alternative to WhatsApp. I like the developer's policy. I hope they polish this app. For example I like my notification SMS to be collected in a single category instead of cluttering the messages list and copying OTPs directly with a copy option and so on and so forth. Nevertheless I recommend this anyone who takes his or her privacy seriously.

	   The UI is clean, no lag whatsoever and it works seemlessly. Don't feel the need for SMS or MMS at all. The only drawbacks are opportunities to get more people on-board (which I feel would make Singal overthrow others) and fix minor feedback like scheduling messages etc.

	<title>Awesome Messenger</title>
	<comment>
	   It's easy to use, secure and open. The only problem I had was actually related to Google's Push Service, and Open Whisper Systems replied almost immediately. Could use a complete encrypted backup option, but that'd be a cherry on top of a perfect cake.

	   I would use this as default in a heart beat. However, when using this as my goto sms txt service, I was frequently getting delayed txts ands sometimes a backlog of two or three at once. Not just a few mins, but sometimes 30+ mins after the person had sent them. Had to uninstall. Hopefully it will improve.

	   Can only trim messages not delete and trim does not work. Huge security issue. Other than that works fine but since that was intentional all security in app is questionable in my book. Data sanitization is a tennant of security.

	<comment>
	   I enjoy the apps ease of use but the lack of features such as scheduled texting, inability to send a quick group text without first adding the persons to a saved group and not being able to archive conversations which are currently irrelevant leaves the app lacking. Still use it on a daily basis for the majority of my texting.

	   Good secure app but notifications are not working in my case even if Signal has all authorisations in its settings and in system settings. Tried cleaning cache+data erase + phone factory reset many times. Even tried with Nova launcher+TeslaUnread. Problematic cause I need to check manually. Android 6, FlymeOS 5, Meizu M3 Max.

	  Snowden's endorsement of this app is misleading. If Snowden been using this app while fleeing the US government, he would have been tracked down via his phone number and caught immediately. Anybody acquiring your phone number 鈥? e.g., via social engineering, as has happened many times before 鈥? can impersonate you.

	   Love it, open source means I rest easy knowing my communications are truly secure. linked to your phone number so you can be sure you're not being impersonated. I wish there was an option to create account withput phone number and manually sign messages with a private key. Serves it's purpose very well. The calling feature cod be improved upon.

	   Easy to use, great design and functionality, clean UI and great encryption. To top that open source. I'm keeping this app as my default message app. I have been using this app since September 2016 and I still like it.

	   Privacy is paramount for liberty. This gives you privacy. The encrypted VOIP calls are better than my service provider. Crystal clear. A great way to get others interested in privacy issues.

	<comment>
	   Works well as a drop-in replacement for your native SMS client (which the old version, text secure, did not). And when the recipient is also running Signal, you can auto upgrade to a secure conversation. Easy.

	<title>Pity it doesn't support SMS</title>
	<comment>
	   Intuitive, reputedly secure and good UI, but very heavy on permissions. Missing an essential feature - it's not possible to send or receive text messages to/from Signal users by SMS (encrypted or not), ie it's unusable without a data connection. It means I can neither make or receive texts when out and about. Migrated to Silence.

	<comment>
	   Even though it's designed for encrypted communication via data, it's also one of the best SMS messengers I have tried. Being able to mark messages as read from the notifications, set custom alerts, plus other features all while being fairly lightweight makes this extremely useful.

	   It's a solid SMS client that transparently makes your conversations private when it can. Whether or not you're concerned for your privacy, pick up this app and let your friends be private (if they want to) when they talk to you. And it's so easy!

	   I'm quite happy with the ease-of-use, and I'm delighted that my texts are encrypted to other Signal users. Also, being able to have encrypted phone calls with other Signal users is a plus. In this age of hacking, is great to have a degree of privacy in my texts.

	<title>Can't text to a fellow Signal user offline</title>
	<comment>
	   In the beginning, Signal offered to replace my current SMS app. Knowing that it is secure, I convince my family to use Signal as well. However we found out an internet connection is needed for fellow Signal users to communicate. I wanted Signal to be my default messaging app (online n offline) but I can't do that if it will only work as an online messaging app

	<title>Only messaging app I will ever use.</title>
	<comment>
	   I recently became concerned about how easily accessible our phones are (stores connecting to my phone and scanning my info) and how deleting messages do not really get rid of them unless they were encrypted first. The only trouble is convincing those I know to use it too so I will be covered if they're exposed or hacked.

	<comment>
	   MMS does NOT work on T-Mobile! There used to be a feature that supported T-Mobile MMS but it got removed. Now it won't display any group texts or URLs or pictures! Great privacy if app is locked. NEEDS FEATURES for: search within messages in a chat/string, need the ability to select-all messages to delete from within a string, the ability to lock individual messages to protect from deletion, and the addition of a private inbox with stealth mode to further secure private messaging.

	<comment>
	   Outrageous and unnecessary special permissions. The whole point of this app is privacy! At times there is huge latency in delivering messages. An hour or more delay is not acceptable when coordinating with people about time-sensitive matters. Calls sound awful when they actually work. I love the desktop feature and that the code is open source. Please add tablet support and syncing between phones.

	<title>Signal is the gold standard for secure messaging</title>
	<comment>
	   Security analysts recently discovered that WhatsApp owner Facebook has created backdoors in WhatsApp that give them & others the ability to intercept and read messages made using WhatsApp. If you need to be sure your messages are secure; if your safety, life, livelihood or business depends on your messages being secure then Signal is the only app for the job. It's initial set up is simple, you don't need a degree in cryptography to use it and it's code is under constant review to make sure it's secure.

	   Great, simple, clean interface - love the look and dark theme! Would love a "schedule text" option, the only thing the Textra app (my previous favorite text app) has on signal. Also, please grant iOS users the same ability as Android to be able to text non-Signal users. That would greatly increase the user base imo, or at least make more ppl likely to switch.

	<title>It's a great app with one exception</title>
	<comment>
	   I love almost every single thing about this app..... except while having it open I still get a notification sound of a new message (which in my opinion is not necessary) and if you are texting someone that writes multiple texts at the same time it overlaps the notification message sound which is fairly annoying. If that got taken care of this app would be truly great

	   Simple design, great functionality. The only suggestion I have is locking separate chats, not just the whole app.

	   This is a great app. Easy to set up, easy to use and got fun functions that other apps don't. I used hangouts for many years and didn't want to switch. But I'm all in for this one. 5 stars! :)

	<title>Cannot verify my sms</title>
	<comment>
	   I was in the process of setting up signal. It failed to verify sms. The next option was to call my phone and provide me with a code. I did this three times. No call. The third time it said I tried too many times and must wait 20 minutes.

	   As it allows you to send messages to anyone, even those not using the service, it makes this leagues better than any other encrypted service I've used. All the normal functions of a texting appwith the added encryption.

	<title>Excellent p2p encrypted messenger</title>
	<comment>
	   The only sms messenger that I know of from a well reputable transparent community of developers. One request though, I would love this app more if you can add one feature to schedule messages. Example: I'll think of something I'd like to ask a friend who works graveyard but I dont want to wake them nor do I want to forget from sending the message later. So Textra will allow me to schedule a text message to send to my friend later or to simply remind somebody of an important date. It's very useful.

	   This is poor coding my friends. So anyone in my contact list of 800 friends family and business contacts just shows up in Signal (without permission) and I can't remove them. This needs to be fixed.

	  For a privacy related app, it's pretty creepy that it broadcasts your identity to everyone in your contact list the moment you sign up. It's hard to trust the app after that!

	   Although i use the dark theme, when i open signal, for a second it loads the light theme, making for a less seamless experience. A wider range of visual customization would also make this app alot cooler and imo, user friendly.

	<comment>
	   It's very useful and I like the security however so far I hate how it will push a notification for people adding the app and for suggestions on messaging others. It's a private messaging service, if I want to use it to speak to someone then I'm sure they are aware and prepared for the message. This isn't Facebook messenger where I'm going to use it to send Happy Birthday to someone I haven't spoken to in years.

	   Not only does Signal provide 1st class encryption that is absolutely critical in this world, but it has a great interface and UX, and it is stable as hell across 3 devices now (HTC One, LG G4 and G5). I use it for all texts and urge all my friends and colleagues to use it with me.

	<title>Great app with some small issues</title>
	<comment>
	   Overall, this is the best messaging app I've found for easy-to-use encrypted communication. The big issue for me is the lack of backup/restore for media messages. I wish I could've migrated more than just the plain-text when switching to a new device.

	   Doubles as nice default SMS app.. has chrome client too.. secure calls etc... I would like to have the option to not be notified of every message from group chats.. just notify me once until I next open the app.. apart from that perfect! This should be baked into android as the default SMS/chat and optional dialer.

	   5 stars for this wonderful app and the sacrifice behind it, done by a dedicated team to protect privacy and the dignity of human being in an era where we are becoming products for international corporations and assets for surveillance by our "democratic" governments. Thanks for protecting people's ass. Some suggestions: - add support for other kind of files, like pdf, office documents...

	<comment>
	   The app tries to auto verify the text message it sends you, but it doesn't let you put the code in yourself, so if it fails to detect your code you have to wait 2 minutes before you can try again or try the phone call. Terrible system.

	   I love Signal because there are no messages to display on the system message app (unlike when using other message apps) only way to view messages is via Signal and with PassPhrase protection turned on no stranger can access your messages trust me.

	   UPDATE: After new update. I sent the same Picture like yesterday (231k). Today it is 1.06M. That is way too much for mobile connections. For Comparison: Threema (good enough quality) --&gt; 81k. + Some things are missing: + Multidevice + run without gappz + remove user from group not working + view and scroll through all media from a conversation + Chrome App should be improved + iOS App is always behind the Android app which is difficult to communicate to ios users. Anyways thanks! I use signal a lot!

	  If end-to-end encryption and privacy is most important to you, this is a great option. If you decide to switch back, though, there's a hole where your Signal messages were. Also, my company firewall blocks Signal, so if I forgot to turn off wifi at work, I wouldn't get any messages.

	   Disappearing messages do not reliably disappear in the time you say. Sometimes they stick around days too long. This needs to get fixed. Also, I don't like that I have to use my phone number, which is tied to my identity. It would be nice to have a more anonymous service

	  I love that you can change the theme and how secure it is. A shortcut way to start a conversation would be nice, though. Something that doesn't require a phone number. A way to send any file would also be nice.

	   And this coming from someone who didn't download it for security reasons either. It's best feature in my eyes is its blazing speed. I might uninstall over the "Invite to Signal" banner at the top of every conversation though. It's obnoxious. There are also little in the way of customization options. I would at the very least like an option to remove all contact photo bubbles. That alone would bump this review up to four stars. Edit: Added a star for image keyboard support.

	   Cannot backup messages, transfer messages, or revert (back to Messages) with this app. Once your messages are on Signal, they belong to signal, you cannot move them. Most ridiculous frustrating situation I've ever experienced with an app. No updates at all on a working SMS exportation. Don't believe the hype. Never again.

	<comment>
	   I love Signal's focus on security and privacy, which might be its killer feature. Integration with SMS also makes the switch easier, since not all your contacts need to be there. Unfortunately, there are still bugs that needs to be ironed out and therefore it's not my primary messenger of choice. One annoyance: when dismissing a notification, it will randomly pop up at a later time only showing the phone number of your contact.

	   Trying to get others to use it though is the only downside. I also don't use it for SMS only signal to signal conversions. I found I just don't like this nearly as much as Textra for just straight texting, but as an encryption app it's fantastic if the other person uses it.

	   E2E encryption is a must these days, glad to see it addressed. Thank you for including integrated quick reply, that is a welcome feature. Bug: following a secure call, subsequent calls will show only a black screen and do not dial or negotiate. The app must be force quit to make another call, please address. Thanks for your hard work. Privacy is freedom.

	<comment>
	   This app is great for me mainly because it has an actually dark night mode, and I can password protect it on a sleep timer with any length of password. It seems to function very well and makes good calls too (if those are encrypted in some way that's awesome but I don't know if they are). I like the idea of the end to end encryption and I hear this app does it the way they should but I'm not familiar enough with the tech to make a recommendation based on that. I think it has a good looking icon too.

	   Pretty random, but 10-20 minutes into a call the call drops and I get a frozen screen. I can't receive calls and attempting to make them returns me to the same frozen screen. I have to force close the app everytime just to work another 10 minutes. SMS is always severely delayed and sometimes doesn't notify you at all. Critical issues. I have a Google pixel. There should be no excuse. How this has 5 stars is a testimony to fake reviews on the Google store.

	<title>Free (as in speech) Software!</title>
	<comment>
	   Being licensed under the GPLv3, Signal Private Messenger is Free Software and thus controlled by its users rather than controlling its users. (Of course, you should obtain the app through a channel which you can trust does not distribute it with malign modifications made to it.)

	<comment>
	   Don't let your conversations be used against you! SIGNAL is the best, open-source encrypted communications program. You can set msgs to expire (like 搂nap鈧琱at) & you can still have unencrypted communications if some of your contacts can't or won't convert. Protect your communications.

	   Smashing! Works exactly how I would like a messaging app to work. I have found no bugs using this app on the OnePlus 3. I have also replaced the default sms app with signal and this also works great. I got rid of WhatsApp and now I use only signal.

	<comment>
	   Brilliant. All messaging apps should offer this level of encryption as standard. Send Later is missing and voice needs improvement. Also it should work on tablets too. It may not be obvious that you may have to switch to plain sms inside the app when sending if one of the parties is not connected to the Internet.

	<title>Why "exact location"?</title>
	<comment>
	   Why does signal require, "exact location" and why so many other permissions to hide from owner of phone? Signal appears to be data mining with all those permissions...? What data is being stored or sent "off of devices"? I have seen reports from my firewall where your app is attempting to send my data when I am NOT using the app. Is this a governmental app or an advertising and data mining app?

	  Where is the crystal clear phone calls?! I have just installed the latest version to try your app but whatsapp is much faster in delivering messages and I was shocked that it doesn't provide phone calls as mentioned in the program features! 鈽?

	   Everything about this app is great except that it doesn't display new msg indicator. Perhaps it's my Nexus 5P or perhaps user error, but it drives me nuts! The other little queries is when I swipe to close the app it takes me back to the home screen, so I have to reopen the panel of open apps again. Otherwise, this app should be rated 5 stars.

	<comment>
	   Some message notifications come in but don't show up in the conversations. Sender shows that I received & read the message. Once this starts, the entire conversation must be deleted and all new messages show up. Anything sent previous to the conversation being deleted is lost. Tried restarting both phones, resetting encryption on the conversation and repeatedly stomping on phone. Deleting the conversation seems to be the only way to resolve.

	   In almost every way, this texting application is a straight upgrade from any other. There are a small amount of features that are missing - searching through text conversations, for example - but overall, an excellent app. The fact that it can rely on SMS, MMS, data, and wifi is excellent.

	   I hear this is one of the few that still actually protects your privacy. Unfortunately WhatsApp is great is it works does not anymore. The government apparently thinks it's okay to take away everything from everyone in the name of "fighting terrorism". This is not OK with me so I will continue to use signal to support them, thanks for such a great app!

	   It was working fine but now it doesn't tell me when someone with "Signal" text me, I uninstalled "Signal" and redownloaded it and it still doesn't tell me. I get text from people who don't have "Signal" or dont have a smart phone, but doesnt say for people who do have "Signal".

	<comment>
	   I moved to this app expecting to sacrifice usability over my previous preferred app. I found I like this one more than my previous app. Update: biggest drawback is the lack of ability to set a default (encrypted/unencrypted) option per contact. It's a hassle to manually disable encryption on many of my texts because my contact stopped using signal. - additionally, group message creation is not intuitive and the group name does not show in the message list. MMS media has an insane size limitation.

	<comment>
	   This text messaging application purports to encrypt my messages. I haven't evaluated that. But it is very easy to use, almost as good as the default android app. The 1% inferiority is that the font size doesn't change with the [volume up] key. That would aid reading without my glasses.

	<title>OK but...</title>
	<comment>
	   Since none of my contacts uses Signal, encryption is irrelevant. As a replacement for my default messaging app (Textra) it performs less well in most respects. It often fails to notify of new messages; it is unreliable in sending messages ( contacts report receiving the same message multiple times); some messages never arrive; sending pics is flaky (file size limit). Could be good but chicken and egg situation regarding userbase numbers. I'll uninstall and revert to Textra for now but keep an eye on it.

	<comment>
	   Signal is amazing, absolutely love it. Wished it had better multidevice support for those with tablets and/or don't want to use Chrome on the PC. Though my biggest gripe is that the backup function only backs up in plaintext, doesn't have option to encrypt backups at all! Wished they implemented WhatsApp's backup system. Lastly, what's with not allowing word wrap and putting overflow words on to a new line?

	   Love the "mark read" feature-saves wondering if the person (also w/ Signal) on the other end got the text, if not able to reply immediately. Found that Signal doesn't like receiving group msgs-would like to see this solved, if possible. Otherwise, liking this app so far.

	<comment>
	   It's a polished turd, but still needs lots of love if this is to look decent. The keyboard inputs only occasionally work, the image gallery is completely broken. Claiming security but not offering encrypted backups is wrong on so many levels. Messages are not reliably delivered despite other messengers performing fine under equal conditions.

	<title>Good at what it does</title>
	<comment>
	   Standard sms app that does everything you'd expect it to. With the addition of encrypted messages between signal users it is very useful. Missing a desktop/web client to fulfill all my messaging needs but apart from that I'm very satisfied.

	   Looks nice, but pesters you constantly to advertise to your contacts (every single time you start a new conversation that it hadn't seen before) and pops up wanting you to rate it. Also has iPhone emoticons for done stupid reason so it doesn't look consistent with anything else on your phone (this can be turned off, but it's a stupid default). Also the server doesn't federate and you can't run your own.

	   Good for sending texts and cat photos, the call feature could use some work. So far so good, though! EDIT: 13 Dec 2016 - unfortunately, when Signal freezes (app won't open), and you follow the advice to uninstall/reinstall, you will lose ALL the messages you've exchanged between when you started using the app and when the breakdown occurs...so backup your messages whenever possible!

	<title>Streamline with traditional messaging apps</title>
	<comment>
	   I haven't run across any of my contacts with the app. Maybe more aggressive advertising. I like the idea of the possibility of encrypted messaging. I most dislike giving to create groups. If this app can be streamlines to operate similar to the traditional apps in respect to sending to more than one recipient that would really upgrade the usability.

	   Works well for SMS and encrypted messages. Very easy to switch as needed making it the only messaging app I need for everything. Phone calls are a great bonus. Very pleased with it - so pleased I wonder how you can afford to offer it for free, given server running costs. Would gladly pay for this.

	<comment>
	   Signal is free as in beer but not as in speech. It's open source, but the author goes after anybody who makes a port and uses the same name, logo, or their servers. This means if I create a better app as a port, it can neither be called Signal (although I doubt that would hold up in court) nor communicate with the original Signal app.

	   Web addresses doesn't open when clicked and there is no option to go from the message to the contact who send it. Doesn't work without data network when you can usually send ordinary SMS without any problem without data network. Also can't share/send pictures directly from the Galery.

	<title>Best crypto messenger</title>
	<comment>
	   despite some missing features compared to the big messengers and a few bugs and rough edges, it's still the only viable crypto messenger with open source code, e2e cryptography, perfect forward security, even trying to protect against censorship

	   I like the way it works, and the company philosophy. Would be nice to have an active icon that shows the number of unread messages, but that's a very small issue.

	  Was awesome until I realised this was causing me to NOT receive important security SMS messages. I have two-factor authentication for many accounts, and with Signal installed, I don't receive text messages from the providers. I have to send a SMS from another phone first, then request another code for Signal, and this stupid "hack" fixes the issue for a few minutes. After that, it stops receiving SMS from providers again. I have a Mi Fit that vibrates when I receive an SMS. It confirms that a SMS has arrived since it vibrates immediately when I request a cod, but nothing on Signal. This is a GLARING bug. What use is security if you can't use the app at all. :(

	<comment>
	   Can you pretty please implement an option to disable the secure session and revert to good old SMS for a given contact? As it is now friends who once used Signal and then stopped using it cannot be contacted anymore from my Signal app as the messages are stuck in the cloud (they no longer use Signal).

	   This app is absolutely the best and on the cutting edge of what we need. thank you so much. It's a simple app that mimics the existing text messaging app pretty closely without copyright infringement. Eventually Samsung and Apple alike will have to have this option included as a standard feature but until the public wakes up and realizes how important this is especially in this era of our newly elected president comma I absolutely believe this app is the wave of the future.

	<comment>
	   Even if you're just looking for a text/SMS/phone over Wi-Fi app for when you travel or just want an alternative to a Google messaging service, Signal is an excellent app with great functionality. This app seamlessly becomes the default app in android. My move to signal was initially for the encrypted messaging and telephony which IMO is essential in the digital age, but even without the encryption, it is a worthwhile alternative.

	<comment>
	   This app overall has all the basics of a solid texting app like Textra with the added benefit of encryption. However it's in the little details where it lacks and has bugged me enough to switch back to Textra. I tried listing all the little annoyances but ran out of room. Each annoyance is small but adds up to a frustrating experience. Once these little details are sorted out I'd love to come back and use this as my main texting app.

	    I don't like is that when my friend deleted his app, I couldn't send him any texts because my app was still stuck in signal mode. Convenient that there was a reset conversation button, but everything is good about it. On par or better than Google messenger, my usual text messaging app.

	   I have only been using it for a few days but so far it has been pretty good.

	<title>Simple and secure SMS App</title>
	<comment>
	   This application is the best for SMS and for secure chatting for that matter. All communications are confidential and all the data stored on the phone is protected with an user defined password. With little interactions needed you can preserve your privacy.

	   Want Marlinspike's encryption but without all the social media hoopla? This is the app for you. Easy to set up and register security fingerprints with the only the people you really wanna securely chat with. no annoying, hundreds of "so in so is using us! say hi to them" or "go bug all your friends in your contact list to use this app!" type stuff.

	<comment>
	   It's a great app, and I love the privacy aspect. Two issues that keep it at 4 stars: (1) you cannot spontaneously text multiple people, you must create a group first, and (2) under heavy load the keyboard stutters and you have to click again to type; never had that with the built-in messaging app. (Used on Droid Mini)

	<title>Gold Standard of Secure Private Messaging</title>
	<comment>
	   Super easy to setup and use. End to end encryption is awesome and takes your mind off of having to self censor. Being able to use it as a complete sms app replacement is great. It has room to grow in functionality to other apps, such as BBM, which has nice features like being able to send multiple attachments per message. That being said there is no other app that brings this level of privacy in such an easy package. That's what makes this the gold standard at the moment.

	<comment>
	   I've used this app for 3 weeks as my default SMS app and I like it a lot. It works as advertised as far as I can tell, and that is in itself worth 4 stars considering g the importance of messaging apps in our daily lives. That it's free, etc., bingo- 5 stars.

	   If only Signal supported P2P for inter and intranet communications. This would remove the greatest threat, the possibility that governments will one day close down servers to prevent secure private messaging. The need for centralization needs to end.

	  I like that it's secure, but it definitely has some drawbacks. Sometimes when I open Signal, it takes a while (several minutes, at least) for it to load in the names and pictures -- and while I wait, it just shows me the phone numbers. I hardly recognize any phone numbers, so I never know who sent what until it eventually loads the names. It does this on several other phones in my family, too. Secondly, it doesn't support Cell Broadcast, so when an emergency broadcast (e.g., Amber Alert or other alert) is sent out, I have to go back to the regular messaging app to view it. No reason Signal shouldn't be able to support CB.

	<comment>
	   I appreciate this application allows for encrypted messaging, which is nice and is the purpose of the application. There are two deductions: 1. Encrypted texting is requires data to be on. I would like to be able to do this over SMS (though I realize that might not be technically feasible). 2. More importantly: Signal seems to be incompatible with my desktop SMS application (Airdroid). Signal offers their own desktop messenger, but it only works with other signal users.

	<comment>
	   I find it a great concept. However, the app fails to notify me on new incoming messages. This happens usually after I have not used the app for a short time. As if it shuts down by itself. So, I have to manually run the app periodically to look for new messages - which is impractical and renders the app not usable.

	   Which renders this app, unfortunately, largely unusable for me. Hope it gets resolved soon. Using CyanogenMod 13 (based on Android 6). Says "Ask every time: not available with Signal".

	   And please stop telling others when their contacts have joined. For a security app you would think they could see how this could be VERY, VERY bad to have a person's presence announced!

	<comment>
	   Downloaded bc husband wanted to use this for us. The app would create multiple messages for 1 person, then when I would tap on a notification, the app would take me to a conversation that I couldn't reply to the person in because "the number wasn't 10 digits". Confusing for the layman. I don't recommend it.

	  I'm a computer security professional and this is my messaging app of choice. It is very secure and works just like SMS. It does lack some features - in particular it doesn't seem to allow composing new group texts, though it can receive them. It also has secure phone calls which is nice.

	   Wanted to replace my Google messenger app with a secure one. I settled on Signal because not only does it provide top notch secure chat, the app can also interact with other messenger apps for unsecured communication with those friends, or family members, who don't have Signal. Unlike WhatsApp.

	<comment>
	   As a stand-alone encrypted message solution, Signal is great and deserves 5 stars. As a text message solution, Signal falls down in basic functionality - most notably for me in lacking MMS support or texting multiple people at once.

	   This is a great app. It doesn't harvest all your contacts (as other messaging apps do without your consent or, more importantly, the consent of every one of your contacts). Peer reviewed code, open source. The web at its best. Thanks, devs!

	<title>Encryption that works</title>
	<comment>
	   Usually getting something like this to work well is technically challenging. Signal just works. It will ask to be default during setup, but you can change that after you get it going. Works better than many SMS apps even without encryption, and adding encryption for the people who opt in is easy.

	<comment>
	   Still a few stability issues on an Android Nexus 6, e.g. sometimes trying to call someone leads to the UI remaining half empty. It seems to happen when two people call each other at the same time. But it's not a bad issue. I can recover by killing the process. I also *really* wish there was a better way to transition when I need to factory reset my device; e.g. encrypted message backup and/or some transition key to cryptographically secure one's intent to reinstall or move to a different device.

	   It seems like each of my friends is on a different app. I love that signal replaces my sms, so it doesn't seem like yet another damned messenger. The problem is that if signal isn't open in memory, it won't notify the recipient of a message.

	  This application is great for easy-to-use encrypted messaging. The fact that you can send both secure and traditional messages is also a bonus, since not everyone is on this platform. My biggest gripe with the service is that I would love to see a true (non-chrome) web/desktop UI as well. I'm looking to replace the functionality of Google Hangouts, and apart from video calling, my most-missed feature is true cross-device access to the platform.

	  The application is light. It's a good alternative for Hangout. It is encrypted. The application need some serious improvement for SMS/MMS animated gif/large image. It's ridiculous that I can't send a regular gif through SMS/MMS but I can do it on any other messenger. Its hard to use the app for all conversations because MMS does not work properly as it is limited. PLEASE FIX AND REMOVE THE MMS LIMIT. ONCE FIXED 5/5

	   Whatsapp with actual security. The only question is why people are resistant to using it more? Also best not to use it as your SMS because if people change their device and don't reinstall signal then they won't receive your texts.

	   We seem to live in a world where some of our own fellow man do as much as possible to take our freedoms, privacy and natural rights of existence from us. Therefore, the fundamental and necessary means to maintain our very humanity require defiance to protect. These self-evident truths should never be subverted, and those who help in our resistance against their suppression should be supported. Signal, and Open Whisper Systems represent those who provide us the tools to help ourselves to help each other.

	   Works very well, allows import and export for easy switching between phones or ROMs. Supports both encrypted and non encrypted messages so will work with any of your contacts whether they use signal or not.

	<title>SMS verification</title>
	<comment>
	   I do receive the message, but Signal just doesn't see it, neither does it ask me to input the received code. I use the preinstalled app for SMS. Tried to set Signal as the default SMS app, it receives the message, shows a notification, but the verification process still fails?!

	<comment>
	   This messenger works really well. I've been using it full time on my HTC m8 and have really been impressed with the level of polish they've added since the beginning. I just wish there were a search function. Sometimes I forget an address or something from a week ago and my only option is to scroll up for miles. The ability to search within a conversation would be the last feature that makes any other messenger superior. It's hard to convince some of my friends to try it when there's some basic feature miss

	   This is the secure SMS app you need. You can replace your current default app with Signal, and the only noteworthy change will be secure conversations with fellow Signal users. All smartphones should come with this app.

	   Only problem I'm having is if I have another app or window open, it doesn't alert that I have a text message. I have to open signal in order to get any kind of notification. Fix that and you get five stars.

Instead of all the different colours.... to much pain to manually individually change all the loud colours to each person.. and volume keys to enlarge message size font like all the rest...bests that. I.dnt know why the world isnt onto this yet...privacy privacy. ...fb msgner no privacy... top app. Simple an clean..will reuse wen fixed

	   The first thing I do when I upgrade my phone is get Signal - never any weird problems for me. Simple; I see 1 mark if sent then 2 check marks showing me that it's been read. And decent notifications; my quiet "Ding" AND small blue flashing LED lets me be aware (LG Stylo2.) GREAT app!

	  The messaging part are great, it also doubles as a standard SMS app. It is possible to call other people via the app, but the call function are hidden away deep in the app. You have to open a message from a person, and then hit a tiny call button at the top right at the message window. I wish the call function could have it's own icon shortcut that I could put on the desktop in my phone. That way I could use it to replace both my standard messaging app and standard call app.

	   Wouldn't understand Signal's open source code, but no effort to fight mass surveillance is wasted in my opinion. I consider Signal the only viable alternative to WhatsApp, as Threema is not for free, so it has a small user base. I hope Signal smashes the WhatsApp monopoly in the long run.

	   Just started using it and the substance is all there, so i'm almost embarrassed to make a fluffy comment such as-- could we have other backgrounds besides black and white? Or maybe to make it easier on the creators, could we set our own chosen image as a background and then just choose dark or light font (as we do now)?

	   The whole approach is to put security first and yet it is just as usable as any texting app. If there were true multi device support it would be an easy 5*.

	<title>Doesn't do it's primary job - sending texts to contacts</title>
	<comment>
	   I used to love this third party alternative to the less-than-stellar Android or Samsung messaging default until I realized people weren't getting my texts. Coworkers and private relationships have been tarnished because the texts I sent out never reached the intended recipient! This may be a sleek, fast and aesthetically-pleasing app but when it doesn't do it's primary job, there's no excuse for that. I'm not the only one who has had this issue with the app, from people on different carriers (I'm on Sprint)

	<comment>
	   I loved the layout and customization of the app and especially loved the fact that my private messages were, in fact, private. However, I had to switch back to my default messenger app, because too many of my messages were failing to send, I couldn't participate in group texts, the app would close when it was supposed to just minimize, and I couldn't send multimedia messages. Very unreliable.

	<comment>
	   Seamlessly replaces your default texting application while protecting your privacy, But once you transfer your conversations into the app, there isn't a way to get them back out. It also limits each message to 160 characters and splits messages longer than that into pieces. Fails to download images sometimes.

	   I used to love it, but as of a couple of days ago, the app went haywire and locked my phone up. Wouldn't let you reply or send text. Keyboard wouldn't work anymore, had to switch back to the standard messenger on my Moto Z Force. Locked keyboard on screen forcing me to restart my phone. Once the bug is fixed, I will use the app again.

	  Works well, seems to provide adequate privacy. Not 100% sure why it needs as many permissions as it claims to.

	<comment>
	   Signal to Signal messaging is sorely lacking. A few days after my friend got signal, message delivery times went way up (sometimes several hours.) disabling Signal messaging fixed this. Would be 5 stars if not for the services delivery issues.

	   I love what this app offers. The developers need to change things like Group messaging. The group creation process is too clunky. Model it after Samsung's messaging app.

	   I'm grateful (truly) that people have taken time to take our privacy seriously - however with that said there are so many little flaws that haven't been addressed in the half year or so I've been using it, one such example is once a friend uses 'Signal' (lets call him Mark) well instead of displaying 'Marks name and number, it's just his number twice... Not too helpful! (unless you fancy leaning all your contacts numbers off by heart?). There are a few others but I see they've already been mentioned.. 馃槙

	   Really good app, but I do miss separate phone app as now I have to use messages I receive in order to make a secure call to the sender - meaning I ought to keep all texts. Maybe I'm missing something? So 4 stars, but as a superbly secure messaging app, it's fantastic.

	<title>Least custom apn's or auto detect follow Textra. This needs the mms fix that Textra has on unlocked Verizon phones with cricket to auto shut down your wifi when mms is sent or Received so I can switch.. And allot of others.. Google the issue, it's huge, gain millions of users overnight and get us off textra app asap!...</title>

	   Your certainly the most secure as even were suggested to use by famous whistle blower Edward Snowden himself in a recent interview. He showed how you guys fought against giving up your access to the NSA and won! You can now open up a new Facebook with that type of reputation that the hold outs that do not want to be tracked will flock to as you gained the trust unlike those sell-outs yahoo amongst many others. Please also release a Cascades blackberry Version in blackberry World for millions more people..

	  i also miss an option to change the font size. since i use my messenger in trains and public places i do not want to have these huge letters everyone around me can read - how stupid is that? and i guess the whole thing is about privacy, right?! why does signal notify my contacts that i use signal? WHY CAN I NOT SET AN CUSTOM RINGTONE FOR CALLS? these are basics! how lame are you guys?

	   The app proved useless because it does not allow me to receive photos greater than 300 kbs. My provider allos it, so i have missed an entire xmas weekend of family snapshots from a family gathering that I was unable to attend. I'll remove this today but its too late now for all the pix I can't see. The app makers ought to warn of the ridiculously low mms limit beforehabd...PROMINENTLY...NOT BURIED IN SEVERAL CLICKS OF HELP FAQS.

	   Not sure but occasionally swipe writing does not go smoothly. Only the first letter of the word shows. If you tap on the letter, the rest of the word shows up. Can't reliably replicate the error. Maybe something I am doing. Otherwise, a great app.

	   Feature I'd love to see: swipe left on a conversation to call. And maybe change the name of the installed app because it's not that obvious that it's an SMS app, maybe write SMS behind it. On the other hand other people won't know that's your sms app... Idk also, please add in line response support for nougat. Apps like Telegram already have it.

	   I like that my messages here are seperate from the other app on my phone. I dont really understand how private it really is but I wish i did. I dint fully trust anything, anyway.

	  It looks great, works well, and the encryption scheme is outstanding. FYI: it uses data rather than SMS to send messages. Per their blog, they could not get the level of security they needed using SMS so they switched. It's a very small amount of data, but that could be a deal breaker for some people.

	<comment>
	   Easy to set up and use. Texts from other signal and regular sms are not shown for days. Bad quality of phone calls. Update: previously messages were delayed up to several days, now they don't arrive at all. I do like the program in itself, but it fails at its core function

	<comment>
	   Tried with mobile data, wifi, none of the options worked, but I have perfect network in every other app, and there is no firewall or anything blocking the connection.. After clearing google play services cache and data it succeeded but at least the app should give a hint because it is a common bug and would be nice to have as a suggestion rather than me have to search for it. Other than this the app itself is really useful and well done. Cheers, Balint from Tresorit

	   A few limitations. There should be a favorites tab where you can add your most frequent contacts. Second when you make a call to a contact that is also on signal it makes the call through signal which is not always wanted. Other than that it's great

	<comment>
	   I use an Android phone and that is completely secure, including not being able to screenshot messages. HOWEVER, if you message someone with an iPhone they can save and screenshot the messages all day long. I've got screenshots of texts within the signal app from an iPhone sent to me. Garbage!!! Fix that, I fix my rating.

	  A decent alternative to WhatsApp. Bonus points for not being owned by an unethical, privacy-invading conglomerate. The app could do with a few more bells and whistles, but works well enough as a barebones messenger, with no annoying DPs or statuses clogging the user experience.

	   Here is what I like. I can receive text messages in the same app as signal messages. This made the transition for family members really easy. I can receive signal messages on my desktop. I can theme the colors and sounds. It even has a dark mode. Now I can do voice messages like WhatsApp. Plus it allows for secure messages amongst Signal users. It works well for me. It's not perfect, but it's close for my usage. I'd like to see improvements on backup/import (media and auto backup) and Google Now.

	   Signal encrypts messages between Signal users, and gives you the option of securing *all* your messages behind a pass code. I love this app and encourage everyone I know to use it.

	   Google play services. Regardless of what Moxie says about it, the app still has a dependence on a Google service. It's an ok app, just be aware of that dependency

	   Love the encryption, surprised by all the permissions needed, and I don't like how my notifications are so random. Most of the time, I only get them when I open the App. That is a problem as some of them have been time-critical and I can't sit opening the app constantly.

	   Open source encrypted messaging, with a nice ui? I switched right away. I only wish you could communicate between different apps that use the signal protocol - WhatsApp, FB secret messages, Allo, and this. That would also further support forks of this system for ui tweaks and added features, because they wouldn't need to convince others to switch to their fork of signal.

	   It's a great app to stay in touch with family and friends, and encryption is transparent. But voice calls are difficult up to impossible to follow, as volume is too low. Will give 5 stars once this is fixed.

	   Frequently you do not get your messages in the due time and/or do not get notifications at all. If you open the app, then suddenly you receive all pending messages (yes, I allowed the app to notify me on every message I receive). This happens with all my contacts that use Signal. It would be interesting to send standard sms when the phone is not connected to the Internet, specially when you use Signal as your default sms/mms app. Nevertheless, it is an app with lots of potential.

	   Love it, most of the time. I compared my installation on G5 Nougat against another user on older Android and mine is missing the Manual MMS settings in the menu. I fear this is why I have consistent difficulties in receiving group MMS. Very frustrating. I have reset the app, reset my APN, and this issue persists. I love the secure message features like setting msg expirations.

	   In these days privacy is becoming a primary concern for everyone. This app is easy to use with encryption & limited info available for anyone who would want to know what we're talking about.

	   I wish more people would use it which would exponentially improve its security features. Regardless, it is still a clean and effective app for regular SMS messaging. Definitely easy to use, has good security, and a clean user interface.

	<comment>
	   Does not consistently send/receive messages often just fails. This app is not using the new app security model, meaning it needs a ton of access and cannot reliably have access to things such as location revoked without potentially breaking core functionality. The developer has added sticker support than modernizing the application for the Android users. Fluff features such as stickers should come after basic update functionality.

	   It did not take long for me to make this my default text messaging app! If I can convince others to install Signal, all the better. It's not about having something to hide, but about a more secure platform as a whole. It fits quite well with my BlackBerry Priv's approach to being a phone.

	  Great. An app that is both free, open source, easy to use, and can't be intercepted. Call quality is excellent. There's a desktop version too! The biggest problem is that it takes over from your default phone app and caller ID often doesn't work. "Reset secure session" wipes your message history on desktop. Could really do with a way to customize the invite message.

	   It does a great job. Very easy to switch over, but also makes it very apparent when you're sending a secure vs unsecure SMS. I think this is important to make people aware of their level of security.

	<title>Use The In-App Passphrase i/o Some Other Inferior Applock From The Market !</title>
	<comment>
	   Small-Sized, yet Robust and Snappy -- the Passphrase feature won't let you see beyond the Passphrase screen ! You see NOTHING inside Signal until you key in the PP. I'm sure you've encountered applock apps that are too slow and late to trigger that you're actually already in the app when suddenly you get "pulled backwards" away from what you're doing in there, backwards through a "threshhold" of a lockscreen that wasn't even there before, and then realize you needed to go through that lockscreen first !

	  Pretty good, but needs a few features: .... - per-group notification muting..... - @ feature in groups (with optional notification)..... - "like" function in group discussions...... - add / edit avatars independent of phone contact avatar....... - text search of message history.....Defect(s): - incoming message scrolls to the bottom when user is viewing message history (should scroll only if user is viewing most recent message)

	   I am now bout to give up on using it encrypted to an iPhone. Plus discovered a picture from iPhone contact being attached to another conversation. TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. HELP. HOPEFULLY JUST MINE.IF NOT FIXED MY RATING DROPS. Love the generic encryption but wish it had more help in its use, especially the IOS Apple version has NO RESET. STRONGLY Suggest SETTINGS include a feedback option and a HELP system. I use Samsung Galaxy S5 and have no problem texting an iPhone. But Iphone owners need help badly.

	<title>Better group chat would be appreciated</title>
	<comment>
	   For everything I love about this app, starting a simple group chart requires the needless pain of establishing a new group/name for the group (which as far as I've seen can't then be searched for later when you want to recall the same members). If you're going to force me to establish an official group for each chat, at least then let me search for that group again by name. That said, it's a secure text option with generally great functionality.

	   This is a secure, fast and light texting app. The delivery reports are not working correctly on Verizon SMS and just return with an error that every message was not sent (although they are sent fine). Will upgrade to 5 when and if that is corrected.

	<comment>
	   This works as a standalone replacement for the SMS app on Android. I can even switch back to the built in SMS app without a problem. My requests: 1) add an archive feature, 2) include better default copy when inviting friends to Signal. Almost everyone thought it was spam.

	   I got the SMS with the code but the app says "SMS verification failed". I did not see any field to put it in. I guess the app is not allowed to read the SMS. The whole point of this app is privacy. Let me type it in myself.

	<comment>
	   This app is now my go to. I've used previous versions and have always gone back to Google messenger because I preferred the aesthetic, but now I prefer the look and feel of this app. It's buttery smooth with very little bugs, and the reply from the notification window now shows your whole conversation, not just the last message sent to you. On top of that, it has some of the best encryption in the industry (as numerous tech articles will tell you. Although, encrypted conversions use data.

	<comment>
	   Glad I got on board with this, Signal's data collection policies really agree with me, and the application is really easy to use and even provides some functionality that native Google message doesn't have (like replying to SMS without editing out of whichever app you're in currently.)

	   Does what it's supposed to do, without crashing or losing messages like some others. You forget you're using an encrypted service which is exactly how it should be! It's also using good open source software that can be trusted, rather than relying on some random app developer for your privacy. Recommended!

	   I've had so many problems with previous messages getting lost in progress or apps being really slow, I use a Galaxy S7 by the way, but Signal delivers (pun intended) in every way possible! Very fast, very pretty display, great quick reply, very reliable, and the security is a good bonus as well. I'd recommend it to everyone for these reasons, I honestly have no real problems with it, maybe it could use more setting options like Textra has, but that's really my only gripe.

	<title>Needs to handle bad connection better</title>
	<comment>
	   My wife and I are testing signal out, using it for SMS as well as encrypted messages. Sometimes if one of us has a patchy internet connection then we don't receive messages until the sender connects to Wi-Fi (sometimes hours later). I would like there to be better feedback for the sender in these cases (who is often unaware that the message has not been received) & an easy option to send an (unencrypted) sms if a message does not deliver. Security is important but reliability and transparencyoften more so.

	<title>Perfect in security, needs work on the interface!</title>
	<comment>
	   It has a very secure feeling to it, and is definitely my favourite app so far except for one thing though. While it provides the perfect security, the interface could be made better especially in comparison to whatsapp or allo, and I don't need a replica or something like them, but a unique UI which is good to look at (though it's not really that bad) would make it perfect!

	<comment>
	   It's easy to set up, secure, and increasingly feature rich and attractive. I just wish it didn't rely on phone number as the unique identifier -- that's a real handicap if you live an international life.

	<comment>
	   I have not quite figured out the notification settings, and most of my acquaintances have no idea what this means, but it works well, so far as I know, with the dozen or so people who use it. I am committed to enlisting everyone to move over to this type of unsnoopable communication, in light of the NSA revelations that each and every person in the world is intended to be surveilled, with no other cause, in all of their forms of communication. To honor the lives of others.

	   It doesn't work between myself and my buddy over in the UK. This app consistently asked if it wants to be my default text messenger. I can not send privately locked messages to my buddy in the UK. Hopefully someone will fill this void because this app is a complete failure

	   After one hour of trying I gave up! After getting the sms code, when it has to verify it, I get a shitty error with "connectivity error" and "no network", even if both are OK and working!  Just tried again today! Same problems! Not working due to some "network error"! Tried both WiFi and mobile network! Still same problem today, 19 Dec 2016! Shame!

	<title>Does not handle pictures and attachments very well most pictures that are taken by my S5 will not attached to a message directly you have to take the picture to the camera first then attach it because it doesn't like picture sizes that the S5 natively does</title>
	<comment>
	   This program does not handle attachments from taking pictures Well if you take a picture through this app you won't be able to attach it because the native picture size for a Samsung S5 is too big this program really has some features need to be added to compete with the standard messenger that comes with Android that allows you to reduce the size of the picture if it's too big or at least this app should allow for Native pictures from the camera on any Samsung S5 to be handled by this messaging app

	   Excellent app. Simply replaces your standard messaging app. Nothing to hide? Nothing to fear? I just prefer not to let hundreds of thousands of civil servants read my texts, emails and stuff.

	<comment>
	   I find the security of this app great. I move a lot and can talk to people all over the world. The only drawback is that I have it as my default message service, which means that messages from friends who are not on signal come into it and then I have to reply in my normal message service. I need to encourage more friends to get on it!

	   So far it works pretty good and I'm able to send and receive pictures but as far as the security aspects I think they only come into play when people you text also use the program. It seems hard to get people to convert. I would like to see the ability 2 send multiple pictures at once.

	<comment>
	   I love this and appreciate that Whisper developed this app so people can send texts securely. I do have one question though, am I doing something wrong or are pinger numbers not supported? I can send texts through pinger and receive calls, but I cannot send the texts with that number through signal. In fact I had to use the call verification because the SMS didn't work when I went in and attached my pinger number to Signal. Love the app though great job guys and gals.

	<title>The most important app on your device</title>
	<comment>
	   The easiest and best app to use in a world where you can't "force" your friends to use encryption - it doesnt get any easier than this. And if they quite simply wont install and change to default. You have NO chance of converting them - which in itself is really sad. Humanity is being invaded, its about time people started to actually care about surveillance. Thank you guys for a truly wonderful practical app. I always download it and set it to default messaging app instantly.

	<comment>
	   Too much of a delay when texting. I sometimes don't receive a msg until half an hour after it was sent. Not good! No other complaints, but that's a big one.

	<comment>
	   This is the texting app to get. Conversations with other users that use the app are secured from all eyes. If someone doesn't have the app it still works, it just functions like your regular texting app. All this functionality comes together in an elegant package, making for the best texting experience available on Android.

	<comment>
	   All conversations between people on Signal are private and encrypted. That includes voice and text. Would have given 5 stars if larger files and more types of files could be shared among users. Otherwise, I use as my main text, mms, and all around messenger.

	<title>Signal with the Grands!</title>
	<comment>
	   After the grand kid's phones were shut off, because my son got tired of paying the bill, I had no way to talk or text with my grandkids. Now with Signal as long as they are home or near Wi-Fi, they can call me or text me whenever they want. Getting switched over from text messaging to this was a little confusing, but other than that I love it!

	   I like the app's functioning. The group text is a bit cumbersome in forcing you to create a group to send a text to multiple people. I created a group & tried to send out & it wouldn't let me didn't tell me why. I thought, maybe there's too many people, but you also can't edit the group, so I can't just try removing a person or two and testing that theory easily. All that said, I still use it as my default because all other functionality I've tried had been great & I prefer encrypted.

	  I installed this after hearing about the Shopper's Charter in the UK. However, you can only Securely Message someone who has the same app installed. And, so far, I've been unable to text or phone my girlfriend, who I convinced to install it. That's unable to text at all, not unable to text securely (I could probably return to using Messenger and text from there, but that renders this app completely pointless.) Not impressed. The support pages don't help.

	<title>It's good but gifs are all to big to send</title>
	<comment>
	   I find the text just perfect but they added stickers and gifs which I was very excited about but nearly all of them give me an error that they are to big to send... So what is the point of adding that option if you can't actually send them? Am I missing something?

	   For a secure app, Signal definitely does not follow security best practices of least necessary access.

	<comment>
	   Relatively good app for communtion. Love the pin option. I'm not perfectly sure how great the security is. But for all the users, I would also recommend VPN usage and as much encryption as you could achieve on your phone, use encrypted McSD's and check for key logging as well. Please change the call connection tone though. Not a very pleasant sound. I have a lot more recommendations for changes for the author, feel free to contact me.

	   One suggestion for signal. Please remove the feature that alerts you when someone else in your contacts installs signal. Its not obvious thats a feature and it really seems to undermine the whole privacy thing your going for when getting the app.

	    on wifi without cell service. So I don't get signal at my house. Which is why I want to text through wifi on my number. Worked while I was in signal, but as soon as I lost service it stopped working. Can't attach the gifs offered says thier too big. Customize options are lacking. There are plenty of other apps that have better features. If it text over my wifi with my number it have got a higher rating.

	<comment>
	   Private messages work great. But images are far too compressed over SMS, can't see detail. And when my previous SMS messages transfered after installation, all threads are missing my side of the conversations about 80% of the time. LG G4 Marshmallow at&t. And no photos were transferred.

	<title>The Finest Texting App Available</title>
	<comment>
	   Signal is an outstanding modern inter-communication tool. It's fast and secure; and while you can just add the contacts off of your phone, you aren't required to include everyone nor to provide personal and private information. Not only do companies and email sell your name and who knows what else, but I've also always felt that facebook would auction off any and all private material for less than a dollar.

	<comment>
	   This is not to bad. I often don't hear when a text comes in though as it seems to not be very loud and not the normal ding so I must check often to see if obe came in. I'm a little confused about whether what texts are encrypted if the recipient doesn't have this app though. It has bright pink color for text which I'd prefer a more toned down color like blue. Other than that, I guess it's fine.

	  Good stuff. But remember to manually export your messages from within the app, if doing (eg) ROM flashing which requires wiping your phone. Signal doesn't use the Android system messages DB, so a normal ADB Backup won't save them. I learnt this the hard way and lost a couple of hundred messages! This also applies when switching back to another SMS app. Any SMS you sent using Signal won't be imported back into the system messages DB, so if you need them, you'll have to manually export/import them.

	   Easy to use, transition from Hangouts was smooth and quick. It's near perfect, definitely recommended and will be trying to persuade my friends onto it over WhatsApp. There are some issues. Notably syncing. If you haven't been on a device for a while, prepare to sit and wait while all the messages sync. Loses one star for being dependent on Google Play Services.

	  Fantastic! My only complaint, and this isn't something the Signal team can control, is that people using other SMS apps can't send or receive secure messages.

	  Looks lovely & is much better then Samsung's default messaging app however after getting a few of my friends and family to use the signal app their names have vanished and instead I'm just given their number?? Not very helpful - I've reset the phone and not limited the apps permissions however no luck - if it wasn't for this one flaw I'd say 5/5 鈽? edit: there are some really annoying issues with this app - it changes my contacts name to their numbers and WONT let me change them...... Why??!! 馃様

	<comment>
	   I find Signal a bit cumbersome after WhatsApp, but I stopped WhatsApp after they shipped to FB. I don't know if calls from Signal don't actually go through normal channels as the interface goes back to normal (& there's no clear Call icon on the Signal page). Also, it doesn't read from my Contacts list; I have to go back & forth between the two & copy/paste. Security is primordial though with State snooping gone strato, so 4* instead of 3. Until I master it.

	   Really don't miss whatsapp only the userbase. Any tips to pursuade people to start using this? Whats with the heart before the phonenumber in chat, that rather looks silly. Each time i start a conversation the "love" heart is onscreen, makes it look like im sending hearts if anyone peeks at my screen. (Heart) phonenumber is using signal! Silly!

	   I mainly use this app for SMS, which it is wonderful at. Just as an SMS app alone it's great. I just wish I could import all my MMS just like you can import SMS. Id also like for the app to stay on SMS when i change from the private message instead of changing back to the private message every time I open the conversation. I also like the idea of different colors for each conversation.

Only issue i encountered so far is that one friend of mine (iphone) won't get my signal msgs on her text app with mobile data disabled, only once shes back online - slightly anoying as it makes me switch messaging apps just to be able to text her. Any chance to solve this?

	   This app has more features then the stock messenger app, it encrypts your texts, and offers encrypted calls. I wish everyone would use this. Prevent the snoops from spying on you support companies that respect privacy.

	   As a texting client this is clean, simple, just works really well. And then is you want to have secure conversations, security vetted by third parties, you totally can by inviting the other party. And it works on computers too.

	   interface is great, it's fast, and it's great to have end to end encryption. Two things that prevent me from giving 5 stars. First is the awful image compression, second is how much of a pain it is to switch to a new device.

	   I downloaded this app because my phone has been very unreliable with receiving and sendung texts , especially from my best friend, which of course is very frustrating , so she and I both downloaded this to give it a try, we have had it for a few weeks and it's been fantastic for both of us ! All of our messages go through quickly. And we have no problem sending or receiving pictures and videos. I wish more of my friends where on here !

	<comment>
	   Great amazing app.. Only draw back is it lacks a private box, scheduled messaging, a favourites tab, & resending failed text by simply tapping on it on notification bar. Improve on customization for individual contact messages, like whether to show message or just contact name on notification bar, customization for individual message bubbles, & the pop up, whether pop up for individual messages automatically closes or remains open after replying, automatic or no keyboard for individual message pop ups.

	   Concept is great, I wanted to use this... but after sending just a few unsecured msgs it flaked out. I sent a msg to a friend and up popped a message box asking "deny" or "allow" - if I clicked "allow" the question box popped up again (loop) ; if I clicked "deny" it worked but of course the message was denied. I'll install again in several months to see if it works.

	   I love your app. Cab you pleas make it optional to zoom in or out the text view when look at a conversion? This would be fantastic and great for users who may fund it difficult to read there conversations. There is a very large demographic of people with this need. Thank you for your time reading my suggestion.

	   Great privacy. I use it as my SMS/MMS app so it uses encrypted messaging with other Signal users and falls back to SMS if they don't. Very easy to use. It has all the emojis but not the "stickers", which is a positive as far as I'm concerned.

	   I will change my score once this app has some more features. If it's going to complete with WhatsApp, BBM, hangouts and so on, it's going to need to adopt other useful features like if the message was read or retractable messages and stuff.

	   I like the idea and encryption but I don't get notifications from other signal users. Their messages only show up when I open the app, so I never get them on time. Regular texts work fine, but that's not what I need it for. So unfortunately useless for me at the moment.

	<comment>
	   So I was content with the app for a while and then started noticing that it was taking hours for messages to come through. This after using the original messaging app that comes on the S7 without issue. What's the sense of having an encrypted message when it takes four hours to get it.

	  My wife broke her phone like a Month+ ago. She had signal installed, now she doesn't want to use it any more. When I try to send sms to her, Siganl sent it thru internet thru signal network and not SMS, so she NEVER get the messages. I tried everything, signal still sending the messages thru their network. YOU MUST ADD AN OPTION TO LET THE USER SELECT TO SEND MESSAGES THRU SMS NETWORK.

I wanted to write to your team and say thank you so much for providing this valuable and powerful tool that essentially makes the statement as it should be said.."While I don't have anything to hide it's none of your business what I'm saying or doing!!" Again thank you so much and to the people who put in the many hours writing code thanks.

	  It's a good sms app if the receiver is not on signal. But if you are on signal and the receiver is on signal too, then this app never uses sms to send message only Internet connection to send/receive messages. I want this app to check weather sender and receiver both are online? If both are online send via Internet, if both or anyone of sender/receiver is offline, use SMS.

	   Having a feeling of privacy is nice. And the app is relatively easy to share with people in different walks of life on different platforms. Now with desktop app, it has come full circle. Just remember that a room can have a $100k lock on the door but your valuables aren't safe if the window's open. This applies to the other end of your conversations, too!

	<comment>
	   I love the integration Signal brought by merging TextSecure & RedPhone into one seamless app. This is my default sms/messaging app. Phone calls are loud and clear most of the time as long as the WiFi reception is decent. A feature request I'd love to see is the option to send quick audio recordings from the app itself (谩 la Telegram by holding the microphone icon). Also, passcode lock per chat/conversation/contact would only make Signal better.

	   I like this app coz have security encryption for messaging and phone. But it will better if the app have the status of interlocutor so we can know real time our chat. And for dissappear message, it will better if the message remains until the message is opened and then the timer for dissappear starts running. For the phone, maybe could create voice louder. I hope you can make it.

	<title>What I would change.</title>
	<comment>
	   I would #1. Allow the text to drop below so we can read the whole text we are sending #2. Signal calling does not work well, calls constantly dropping, or barely being able to hear voices not to mention once that happens it stays ringing in my speaker until I restart my phone. #3. Allow us to lock Individual text from being deleted. Otherwise I love the app.

	   That's actually the reason I knocked off one star: I've had trouble sharing the app with iPhone users because the feature set is a bit different. Overall great app though. It makes security accessible to everyone.

	   Signal deserves a resounding 5 stars for its simplicity, built-in security, and for its ad-free stability. Few apps deserve this rating more.

	<comment>
	   In this age we all need encryption and this app is very easy to use, has a clean look and feel. Disappearing messages, no screenshots, encrypted calling are top. The app does not take up alot of space either. Nit at all glitchy. My only objection is I dislike the apple style emojis! This in an android app and therefore should use the same as we are used to :P

	<comment>
	   This application functions very well. Simple yet manages to meet all my needs along with having enhanced security. I really enjoy the image filter feature. I only have two small critiques. First, when importing to Signal it doesn't capture my images in my previous SMS messenger. Second, the search feature could be more sophisticated. I would like to be able to search within conversations and not just for the conversation itself. Otherwise well worth the switch. I am actively recommending to everyone.

	<comment>
	   One of the few apps that allows for actual secure texting (end to end encryption among Signal users.) For the paranoid like myself, use PGP (or other) encryption over this app (and really this app is open source get it on github and vet it yourself.) The gov doesn't need to know your business.

	   As many, I wish more contacts of mine use this. But even as a plain sms app replacement it works great. Would love a feature to share a sms to other apps. Handy when you've a reservation number or something that you want to post elsewhere like Evernote etc. There is copy/paste but that's clunky. Anyway I'd recommend this app to anyone hovering over decision to install it. Normal sms functionality is great too.

	   If you save your contacts on a SIM card, you don't see their names, only numbers. Several attempts to contact tech help was useless. They told me to move my contacts to the phones memory. Sorry...no way...Lost 300 + contacts thay way when previous phone died. They haven't responded to my 3rd email now in over 7 days.

	   I think the next step can be better internet gadget integration or just gadget integration to avoid weaknesses existing in software and hardware of current android phones. Two step verification for important calls and text-messages.

	   Works well; it's easy to set up, configure, and use. I wish more of my contacts would sign up so that we can make use of the end-to-end security. Still worth making the switch from Android Messages, though.

	   The only downside is most people don't want to be bothered with switching from their default SMS, so I haven't been able to experience the end to end encryption, but have had no tech issues and big boner for the dark mode.

	  The Signal app is just as easy to use as any other messaging app plus you get state-of-the-art end-to-end encryption, not just for texts but also voice calls (the recipient must also be using Signal). A must have these days to protect our privacy.

	   Converts emojis nicely and keeps messages together instead of splitting it like many Android messengers. My only complaint is the videos that you receive are really poor quality. If that got fixed I would give 5 stars.

	   In my opinion, this would be 5-stoar awesome if it had Google Hangouts integration and still handled true SMS communication instead of relying on a data connection. Edit: lowered to 3 stars because group messaging is unacceptable when testing multiple people not using the service. 12/8/16: while I haven't had to use the group messaging, it's reliance on mms and the internet has proven to be a problem on Cricket and when using a VPN. Otherwise, I use it as my daily driver.

	  The best secure messaging you can get out of the box. Disappearing messages, crypto that's become industry standard, and they retain no useful info to be subpoenaed (see the gag order they fought and overturned). It's the only messaging app I use any more.

	  It's very similar to whatsapp, only encrypted. If you like whatsapp there is no reason not to love this. My only issues are it would be nice to see when your chat partner is online, and if they read the message. I see the 2 checkmarks after the message is sent but no way to indicate if it was read our not. Update December 08 2016. Apparently this still stands today with the latest version

	   Works like a charm. Finally a message similar to iMessage where you can send both SMS and secure encrypted data messages to other people. Should be a standard on all phones. Would love the ability to be able to backup messages directly to the cloud instead of the phone then copy them over to cloud. Keep up the good work.

	   This is a great app. I was very skeptical at first, but I've looked at the code and it's pretty solid. Nothing is unbreakable, but you'd have to be a crypto expert with an abundance of resources and debugging skills to even have a shot at breaking this. Hands down the best mobile messenger on the market. Worthy of default status. The only reason it's not a 10 is because it needs read receipts and writing bubbles as iMessage has. If you add this. You will be my new favorite company.

THIS APP CAN HOSE YOUR SETTINGS SO BADLY, YOU HAVE TO DO A FULL FACTORY RESET LIKE I DID. This company's answer to my support request, when I tried to find out what settings in my phone they changed, was to tell me to ask the other company whose app these bozos screwed up! I want NEGATIVE STARS! I give -5 stars. This app sounded promising. NOT!

	   The coversheet is a nice in addition to the encrypted message database, which. prevents someone from looking at the people you text even if the message is encrypted. The end to end encryption works well, I appreciate the open nature of the development, which keeps everyone honest.

	   Snowden approved! Bruce Schneier approved! Best part, though, might be that it is a better messing app than the stock Android messaging. It handles group messaging properly. It sends regular SMS/MMS to people in your contact list that don't have Signal, and secure messaging for people that do. Plus it syncs messages with the desktop version or other multiple devices you have. There is absolutely no reason for anyone on Android not to immediately install this. Improve your security and privacy today!

	   I straight up deleted my old messaging app that came installed on my phone. Signal is very easy to use and looks great, easy to use no matter what messenging app you've used before. Far far more secure to talk and text using signal than anything else. If you are concerned about your security or just don't like the horrible and corrupt and useless nsa, signal is for you!

	<title>Best secure messenger available</title>
	<comment>
	   Signal is, by far, the best secure messenger around. Open-source encryption is certainly the way to go if you value your privacy. Furthermore, the Android version has a bunch of useful security features that set it apart from other messenger apps.

	<comment>
	   I wish I could love this app. I love the idea, but the app itself is just inconsistent. I sometimes get notifications for muted conversations, but not always. I sometimes get alerts that show the phone number instead of the name that's saved in my contacts. Only some conversations show up on desktop, and I can't figure out the pattern of which, I'm pretty sure it's not just Signal users. I would love for everyone I know to use secure messaging, but I don't feel good about recommending Signal to most people.

	   Really good app. Good features. There is skepticism in the online community that government agencies can still tap into your conversations in this app. Yet it doesn't matter. It s good to protect yourself from black hats and grey hats. Thank you for including the call feature in it as well. Really happy with it even though the call quality can become average.

	<title>Broken Multitasking</title>
	<comment>
	   I would love this messenger if the multitasking function actually worked with it. If you switch to another app you're forced to reopen signal from your app drawer, as it disappears from your multitasking list. And if you swipe to close it in your list, it closes the multitask list all together. Very frustrating.

	  I'm enjoying the app so far, it's fairly simple to see that messages are sms vs signals though a lack of a data connection has made switching frequently a necessity, itt would be nice to see a notification when a message can't send and the option to resend it as an sms. I'd also like to see a standalone desktop application for Windows.

	   Only comment would be to ensure your defaults are set properly regarding wifi preferences and discard messages at 200 per conversation... But awesome.

	<comment>
	   Great app, good replacement messenger app. However, I swiped away an important conversation and can't locate the archive view (that's mentioned on the website) to recover the archived conversation. There's nothing on the FAQ in the android app section that explains this. There's some mention of an archive view in the forums but nothing to explains how to get to it.

	   I began using this app for it's clean interface, after becoming annoyed with my previous messaging app. I have not made much use of the encryption features since most message exchanges are not with other users of Signal, but on the few occasions I have, the process is as easy as sending a normal text. I'm quite pleased with the app's stability and function.

	  Better than my stock messaging app. I like how I can mark a text as read without directly going to it, and if I go to my messages screen it won't dismiss the notification when I didn't even read my texts.

	   A very reliable secure messaging app. The App to App voice calling feature is also very useful. Some tweaking needed in the GUI for blocking spam messages quickly. At present one has to do many clicks for this.

	   I really like how easy this was to install and how I can sync contacts. The only difficulty is one is sometimes forced to redo contacts to make signal recognize you both have it and can send an encrypted message.

	   Why does it use data to send messages? Why not SMS? Most people have free SMS, and it's cheaper than using data to send messages.

	   Looks and feels much like a normal text app, which is good. However, texts sometimes come through twice, and an indicator on the icon to show the number of unread messages would be welcome.

	<comment>
	   Screws up group texts. Recipients won't receive messages from ANYONE in the group and there's no way to know it's happening. Won't resize files (pictures, videos, etc) that are too large to send. I spend a lot of time switching back and forth between my default message app and this one and I'm not sure it's worth the trouble. Update: Found out it was straight up not delivering messages to certain contacts. Uninstalled immediately.

	<comment>
	   I actually got this because I wanted a easier way to copy and paste text messages in bulk. It made it pretty simple, plus I love for interface better then the stock messaging app on my S5. The encryption is a nicr bonus too! Protip: go to settings and change to dark them to make it even better.

	   It's all there for a messaging app. And if a function isn't there, they will make it happen. I asked for voice message option, and it became a thing soon after. And the even emailed me to let me know it was updated. True pros

	   Signal has a better interface than the default app; you can mark texts as read without going into it. It also tells you when your friends get it, so you know who you can communicate securely with. Everyone should get this app, both to secure their own communications and to normalize the use of encryption so it isn't a reliable indicator of criminals/dissidents.

	   Behaves just like a regular SMS app, handles all SMS and MMS transparently. Of course the best feature is the encryption, which is enabled when the recipient is also using signal. No complaints.

	   It is 100% free with no ads. End to end encryption for text and even phone calls. What more could I possibly ask for? Less frills means less security risks, which is why I am not even enabling the emoji support this app boasts. Plus, it is why I am not requesting any add-ons like the typical non-security minded user. I will however ask for one feature, please give us encrypted video calls too. Thank you for all this work and for making it free with no ads! &lt;3

	   This app is not private it makes you register your number, with the new right the FBI has this is no more private than sitting in an interrogation room with a cop present telling your buddy you have 100KG of heroin.. what a joke this is false advertisement at its worst. If you think this is great security you have no clue what you are talking about, I put my degrees on it as I have been in information security for 20 years.... jokes jokes jokes

	<title>Encryption... for a price</title>
	<comment>
	   Requires almost every permission on your device. Also imports all of your texts into a db... I guarantee you the original copies are still on whatever database they were already on. Then locks you out of the sms and phone apps on your device. No thanks. I wish we lived in an age when I could trust another 3rd party with my info. If not a straight NSA front, it won't be long before they infiltrate the company via the now-well-documented plethora of options available. I'd rather deal with the devil I know.

	<comment>
	   Love the encrypted texts and all the options that come with it but when I try to make a call through it I can't hear the person on the other end and they can't hear me. I love that we have code words but if we can't hear one another, what's the point? It weekend beautifully the first few times we used it and then it stopped. I'm disappointed. I still love the messaging qualities and will keep using it for all my texts but I'm using my phone's telephone app for calls.

	<comment>
	   Need to be able to disable calls completely, on some contacts or turn ringer to vibrate only on calls at night etc. Has NO selective options on calls nor can I silence a call if half asleep like I can on my regular calls. Volume doesnt even change so easy to get woke up! Removing until fixed or finding a new app to use.

	   Only downside is the icon vs the iOS version and the lack of more colour options for conversations. Otherwise great!

	   Easy to install and use. Hopefully, as secure as it claims to be. Cons: Doesn't have a favorite list for those you text frequently; also my stock Samsung app notified by voice of one of those favorites texted me. Those two items are very convenient. That keeps it, IMHO, from a 5 Star rating

	   Safe, secure, private and it woks well. The fact that you can receive both ur secure signal SMS's (between you and your smart friends who are also using the app) and regular text messages with ur 'not-so-smart' friends in one clean app is great.

	   thank you for this wonderful app, for its nature of delivering end to end encryption messages. its not like we have something bad to hide, its just that we really appreciate our privacy.. our private moment being a conversation with our partner or a meeting with a friend. As my oncle said, when we want to share with everyone, we know where to.. and when we want our private moment, we have Signal. good work, lots of greetings from Spain with love.

	<comment>
	   I love Signal and convert anyone I can to it, but I've run into bugs that haven't been fixed despite being reported over a year ago. The developer's response to this is basically "It's open source and we're understaffed. Fix it yourself and submit the fix". And yet we have GIPHY support now? Who even asked for that?

	<comment>
	   I'm a major fan of the security provided by this software. Ability to send larger files vs my cell carrier,having a "delivered to device" 2nd check mark, plus VoIP calling are a few major perks! I'd appreciate the ability to add a "Subject" to the pictures and not have them automatically open, please.

	<comment>
	   This app is great for SMS, and I like the features. However, MMS is a nightmare when you use this app to talk to someone who isn't...for starters, I can never receive MMS, always says the download failed. Then if I want to send a MMS, it has to be under 300KB...my default SMS app allows for 1024KB. It's very frustrating because I want to use the Signal app, but now I have to use two apps for MMS and SMS. Signal to signal convos work great though

	   Its pretty weird to recieve a Txt that I've almost reached my account txt/mms limit with verizon. I thought Signal uses internet, is that so? Does a message not sent to a signal user count against your total cap for txt/mms? Sent debug file 10:21 PDT

	  Good concept. Easy to set up. I wasn't able to enter my verification number. That screen never came up. So when I go to send messages it says "send unsecured SMS" which defeats the whole purpose of the app. Also, it seemed to delete recent messages I've received Will be uninstalling.

	   Couldn't ask for more. An open source app that provides end to end encrypted chat and phone calls. Doesn't try to sell you anything and you don't need to make a special account. All you need is a phone number. If you care about privacy, it's the obvious choice along with ProtonMail.

	  This app would be terrific except for one problem. I have the phone sitting there with Wi-Fi or mobile, strong signal, and volume up. I am expecting my wife to send something but I get nothing. I grab the phone to look, only to find there is no notification. I open the app and suddenly it goes "bing!" and shows me a new message, sent "18 minutes ago". I was here the whole time. What happened? This keeps randomly happening. When this happens, FB messenger is not having any issue. I don't think there is a net issue. What's worse, it shows the message as received to the other person, so I think it went through, but its off in la la land somewhere deciding to show up a random amount of time later. Very bad for communicating, just causes arguments with people talking past each other, with no idea that they are getting delayed.

	  There seems to be periods were there are delays in receiving messages, several hours worth. And this service being dependent on internet is also a negative for those that mostly use Wi-Fi. (I had data and Wi-Fi and still had delays in receiving).

	   Missing simple things, like read receipts and custom themes that improve the overall UX. Had some iOS issues with my wife that prompted us to move to WhatsApp. Also, the voice server software is not Open Source for public audit. However, the app on Android works flawlessly, the E2EE is state-of-the-art, and the UI clean. Still highly recommended.

	<title>Best Open-Source Encrypted Messenger</title>
	<comment>
	   Pretty flawless system. Other than that: Bring a badge/icon system where each contact that has Signal would have an icon assigned next to their image and name. For this badge/ icon to be active, they must have download/installed and currently have it set as their default messaging app. This would make it much easier to identify who could send an encrypted message to. Also, include a feature for Signal users to be notified for when another Signal user takes a screenshot of their conversation.

	<comment>
	   I'll be honest, not a lot of my friends use signal, but for my friends who do, it's fantastic, but even using Signal as just a SMS client to message people not on it is a fantastic experience, clean and smooth.

	   It was not immediately apparent, but after some guesses, I found the delete msg option by holding the item for a quarter second. A menu appears, including a trash can. Nice touch. Slide right to archive is a nice feature too. All in all, well done.

	   Great messenger, love that there is SMS integration within the app! Only one thing... Please add an option to separate notifications into single messages when there are notifications in multiple conversations! In the current notification which combines all pending convos, messages cannot be read on some wearable devices.

	<comment>
	   Good interface, great idea for security, but MMSs are borked. Since 90% of my texting is group messages to coworkers or sending quick pictures, there's really no reason for me to use it or to recommend that anyone else does unless you're strictly using it for text one person at a time.

	  Needs the option when a secured message is not delivered within specified time to send it as an sms. Two users that have signal but one of them is offline, messages are not delivered until he comes back online. If you don't know if the other one is online the app should have this option to switch to regular sms automatically. Can't add logo to group messages. It only accepts displays favicon size images

	<comment>
	   Absolutely loved the app until I realized that it sends messages via wifi. I'm using republic wireless with no dataplan so it meant not being able to send SMS messages when not connected to wifi. I think it also caused errors with MMS messages not sending. If I ever get a dataplan I'll be back.

	<comment>
	   I decided to download after reading about President Trump's cabinet's position on the NSA's abuse on the 4th amendent and decided I wanted to protest in a small way. I saw an article about the rise in downloads for this app after the election and looked it up. After reading a while bunch technical stuff that went over my head, I decided this would be the best way to protest the battle against the crackdown on encryption. Easy to use and a nice looking interface. Also try to donate through their website.

	<comment>
	   Can't be more effusive in praise for this app or company. The nonprofit OWS keeps next to nothing about you or your conversations on their servers. Even better is the app can also handle your SMS/MMS too, serving as a fallback until someone in your contacts joins Signal. There's also a great desktop client so you can message securely from your laptop. One suggestion for improvement: raise SMS attachment size from 300kb!

	<title>Best Secured SMS</title>
	<comment>
	   It's rated as one of the most secured texting apps. It also can be used to text people without this app making it the only SMS you need. The only downside is that there is not much user customization and no user guides at all. Another downside is that deleted groups don't really go away, which is a bit creepy. Don't believe me? Install the desktop version and you'll see the deleted groups. However it's still a 5-star app considering it's free.

	   Main issue is with phone calls. When a call pics up there is an annoying chime so you can't hear the other person at first. It also drops calls a lot. Messaging is limited in attachment abilities but not by too much. I still use this as my primary messages but not my primary calling app.

	   It's a neat app, but it requires so many permissions for a lot of features I do not use. I will review my rating once the app is updated for Android 6's permissions system where I can safely revoke a lot of permissions.

	   I like the security, I think, but ironically it requires more permissions than non-secure apps. Only thing keeping me from making Signal my default app is lack of a scheduling feature for messages like Chomp has.

	   Encryption baked in was the draw of course, but even without it I would continue using this as my primary SMS app. Has a dark theme, can reply without going to the app (hopefully they bring in notification shade reply soon too), elegant and minimal design are all pluses. The encryption is definitely worthwhile, plus the disappearing messages is an added layer of security. Get this app!

	   It's easy to use. Doesn't require the other user to have it installed (however, doing so would make the messages vulnerable ) and has a dark theme. Sold!

	<title>Everything I want</title>
	<comment>
	   Simple interface, actionable notification with mark-as-read and quick reply (must-have for me), reminiscent of CM messaging in android 4.x which I like. I don't really use the encryption but it's nice to have and not in the way if you don't want to use it. This has pretty much everything I want while still staying clean and simple.

	<comment>
	   Been using it for less than 2 weeks and so far, it's comparable to the default messenger app. It's a little bit unintuitive but a quick search on their FAQ can mostly answer your questions. Minus one star for that and difficulty creating a group chat. And using Apple emotes, which imho is less aesthetically pleasing than Android/Google emotes.

	<comment>
	   I like exploring apps in depth, even if this is usually a time consuming process. This app, however, is both deep and simple. Very straight -forward to use, but with interesting options for those who want to go under the hood of the default settings. Probably the best comm app I've encountered so far.

	  It's a good app, as such things go. I trust my conversations on here to be private far more than I trust other apps which have implemented Open Whisper, like Facebook and WhatsApp. It does bother me, however, that your account is tied to your phone number. Phone numbers are some of the most traceable identifiers on the planet, and would therefore seem to work against the concept of a totally private messaging experience. It feels like a different, more anonymous unique identifier would be possible.

	   I had some setup issues which were nothing to do with the app, and everything to do with crappy cellular coverage; Needed to find a spot with good enough WiFi and good enough Cell Signal to get started. Once that happened, plain sailing, and I can even send encrypted Cat Memes, which I'm counting as a victory.

	   When you can install it the app is great, works well and fast and allows to send and receive all your messages. Unfortunately it will not update on older phones and it will stop working. the previous update I could finally install it after many failed trials, but this latest it keeps failing the installation (error code -11), so finally I had to give it up.

	   I use this app for many things, mostly activism purposes. Its very functional as a messenger. All the extra features it boasts are all there and seem to work very well according to my fairly limited testing. This removes a lot of the hassle from semi-secure communication. I would recommend this app to everyone. Drop your stock messenger and switch to signal!

	  I love the interface way better than my native app and really wish I could use Signal as my default texting app, but it doesn't always send my longer texts and MMS or media attachments. I don't have a data plan, and so MMS stuff doesn't send or receive when I'm away from wifi. But sometimes things fail to send or receive even when I'm in wifi Internet range.

	   I'm always suspicious of things where I can't see all the parts, but people I trust have audited signal and say it's good. It is also easy enough for non-technical folk to set up, and integrates seamlessly with SMS messaging. So I'm giving it a cautious thumbs up.

	   Works well, but lacking a widget so can view/respond from home screen. Dev tells me no plans to add. Also need ability to add photo to MMS from Dropbox.

	   Even if you are not a dissenter, normalizing this way of communicating protects those who do voice dissent by making them difficult to single out. Encrypt today. For someone else's freedom of speech if not your own.

	  I'd have rated higher if it didn't keep bugging me to message people I haven't spoke to in years and, in many cases, don't want to speak to ever again just because they too have signal installed. Other than that, it works well, it renowned for being the best encrypted messaging app, and everybody should be using encryption so download it now

	   Haven't looked into the legitimacy of the security, it I can speak to the functions of the app. I have had no trouble using it, no ads.This rating may be the only thing the app has ever asked for. It works without changing any details or functions of other messaging apps and has fully replaced them because I prefer signal. Only thing I would change is that replys to group messages are sent to everyone in the group rather than just to the person who sent the original. I regularly Suggest it to my friends :)

	   If you value your privacy and your right to speak freely without fear of who else might be listening, signal is for you. Easy to set up, easy to use, I can't think of a single reason why someone wouldn't be using this.

	   After about a week my contacts without signal said that when they tried calling me that they got a message that my phone number had been disconnected. Pity, I really liked the app until this happened... :/ UPDATE: My phone started working again. I'm upgrading my review to a three, but it's pretty scary that I lost all ability to be contacted out of the blue.

	<title>Some problems</title>
	<comment>
	   First, let me start by saying I love this app. The problem is since the last update I don't get notifications of new messages until I open the app manually. People will tell me they sent me a message then I will click on the app to open it and it will alert me but not until then, which is a serious problem. Hopefully this will be fixed in the next update. If it is I will get it a better review and at least four stars. Thank you to the Developers for this fine app!

	   This is the best messaging/sms app I've tried so far. Does everything I want it to do, with the added bonus of privacy with other users. The in-notification response feature is my favorite; every app could use that.

	    interface than wickr but still doesn't suppress screenshot so mostly worthless from a security perspective. Still better than normal texting. Will allow self destruction of 5s though so that's pretty good if you can read that fast. Wickr does offer the ability to truly remove deleted items which this doesn't offer. On the whole just do both. But as a texting interface this is definitely a better option generally speaking than other stuff out there.

	  The gold standard for private, secure, transparent, and independent IM and phone calls. Make Signal your default messenger app and recommend it to all your friends. We should care more about our privacy and a free society in general. To the developers: keep up the good job and don't get lazy. There is some fierce competition out there. Update 16/11/07: New features such as GIFY support are amazing.

	   I think about these things a lot, and I can say confidently that Signal has the best onboarding experience of any app meant to replace another app. 60-180 seconds, and you'll be back to texting where you left off but measurably safer.

	  Great app overall but has issues synchronising after lost connectivity. Instead of just sending a notification and vibrating once, it vibrates for each past message received (even if it's from one contact), which is really annoying. Generic web application (not tied to Chrome apps) would also be nice.

	   Its an encrypted messenger. That is good. Everything works as I would expect it to. Only nitpick is that I wish there was a global setting for contact color. I end up turning every contact blue in the dark theme because that is the easiest for me to see.

	   Signal is second to none when it comes to encryption and security. I have only one caveat and the is the sound quality is 3/5 when calling and goes down when trying to use a headset or headphones. Other than that, great app, and I'll continue to use it.

	   I was hesitant at first, despite the benefits of an encryption, expecting a clunky messenger and a slow interface. I was SOOOOOO wrong! The app is amazingly clean, and I much prefer it to Google Hangouts. Encryption services are easy to use, and there are a handful of other neat features too. Very grateful for this app!

	<title>Easy messaging app</title>
	<comment>
	   I work in an area with spotty cell reception but have a good WiFi data connection in the building. I can now send messages without them failing. Plus these are end to end encrypted for other Signal users which is a great idea. For people who don't use Signal, messages are treated as regular SMS. The app is very easy to use and setup is not difficult at all. I now use this as my default messaging app. Highly recommended!

	   Occasionally I will have to reinstall the program in order to get messages. Limit size in certain file types feel too small. Voice quality is much better then before but still leaves some to be desired

	   Great app just wish more used it. Its nice that you're not adding to the long list of chat apps you already have as this can function as your sms app too. It functions as an sms app very well too, even has simple sms backup options for when you change phones etc.

	   If you support the 4th amendment, and don't believe in the idea of "if you're not doing anything wrong, you've got nothing to hide," than this app is for you. And if you live in a country that doesn't have the 4th amendment, then, hey, at least you have a smart phone.

	<title>Android 7.1 issues?</title>
	<comment>
	   Is anyone else having issues in Android 7.1? I switched phones (I did not have any issues before) and on my new phone contacts are only displayed as phone numbers (versus as names) in conversations. I'm **not** having this issue with any other apps that access/use my contacts. I also can't respond to preexisting group messages.

	   Signal easily imports your SMS settings and becomes your default means of communication. It even let's you know who in a conversation isn't encrypted, so that you know which messages are truly private.

	<comment>
	   I've spent the last few months trying out every popular SMS client I could find, and even without considering the encryption features this one is the most stable and least obtrusive, plus it's more feature-rich than the runner up (Google Messenger). Oh yeah, and it hides you from Trump's NSA. That's gotta be worth something.

	<title>Removing encryption from SMS sucks</title>
	<comment>
	   This app is now useless. Encrypted SMS messages was the reason I bothered to install it. Sending 'TextSecure' messages makes sense only when both me and recipient are online. But then I have hundred of other convenient options for secure communication (XMPP with OTR, GPG signed email, etc.). Encrypted SMS was the major feature of this app. And now it is removed. LOL! Also, sometimes the app does not receive messages. When I open the app after couple of days not using it, messages from past start arriving.

	   Shouldn't notify phone contacts when you create an account, especially without giving you an option. It seems to somewhat defeat the objective of being discreet and private. Other than that, app is quite useful.

	<comment>
	   It's a a shame that the telephony servers are not completely free software, and that the app is not officially offered on F-Droid. Also having issues with notifications, receiving and sending photos... Has been acting pretty erratic in the last two months.

	   This app is perfect with the exception of the connections to other APIs like Giphy, etc. I recognize it is done in a secure way but I would only recommend the app stay fast and minimal.

	   Five stars if push notifications could work on my device. A good trustworthy replacement for any stock sms offering that automatically end to end encrypts msgs and calls between signal users. Cross-platform functionality between android/ios baked in. Private call feature makes it something special.

	<comment>
	   This app has some great features. I love the ability to mark received messages on "read" right on the notification. Unfortunately, the app has not imported the names of my contacts properly. Some are shown, but most are just phone numbers. It's tolerable for me because I only text on o daily basis a few people whose numbers I know.

	<comment>
	   So far I'm very satisfied with this. Voice calls work properly, sound is good, and it connects fine. It doesn't have much blows & whistles, but it simply does what it is supposed to. And of course, since source is available, I have confidence the encryption also works properly; though I haven't read it, I suppose it has been properly peer reviewed by others.

	   The app works very well as an sms replacement and provides excellent, secure messaging and calling(!) with others who use the service. Open source code means public security audits and high recommendations from security publications. Minor gripes are frequently fixed in updates.

	   For some reason even if notifications are enabled on my phone, I don't get the notifications. My phone will buzz a little bit but the notification sound I have doesn't even play all the way through before the notification disappears. I have it set to remind me a few times when I have a text, but it only vibrates once. Any way to fix this?

	   But maybe not much more than that. Not as obvious as maybe it should be that it's unencrypted when sending regular SMS, and it seemd to have failed to bring in some of my contacts; the first week was a lot of nameless phone numbers.

	   Signal is the most secure messenging platform available! With all the typical features found in a messaging service plus the privacy afforded by encryption and auto-disappearing texts, Signal is the single most useful app download I've made in over a year and I'm gradually sharing it with friends! There is a Signal Chrome App is well such that you can message from your computer as well, significantly speeding up communication while at the computer. An all around amazing service made by awesome citizens!

	<comment>
	   Tried Signal but found that it was still pretty limited in basic functionality. Also, receiving messages were frequently delayed. Often I wouldn't receive a message until I opened signal and then got a whole lot of messages come in hours after they were sent. Can't really send to multiple contacts without first creating a group. Can't include additional contacts when relying to a message. The privacy thing whilst nice, in reality is not useful because all my contacts refused to use it.

	   This app is solid and works at 99.5% efficiency. It also prevents screen grabs from text, keeps no records of phone calls. And has auto destruct on messages sent to other phones, so they have a time limit before it disappears. I wish to donate money to this project! I combine this app with my paid subscription to Kaspersky for full complete protection from the evil Zionist-supremacist Mi6.

	<comment>
	   Why no favorite quick contacts at the top? Makes it slow to use for frequently contacted people. I would also be more likely to auto invite people if I could customize the message to say something else. Like "encrypt your messages with Signal"

	   This company really cares about security and privacy. We make sacrifices in both areas just by carrying a cell phone, but Open Whisper Systems gives you back some of that which had been previously lost. Additionally, they're open source which, with a large user base and dev community, means more secure. I trust this app for these reasons. Thanks again Moxie, Open Whisper Systems, and all the devs who have chipped in.

	   But who's going to make every one of their friend install an app to use it for the sole purpose of installing the app? Everyone I know already has a messaging app they like. The odds of folks changing are negligible.

	<title>Great app except for group texts</title>
	<comment>
	   Interface is good, functionality is great and I like the security. It is annoying to get the message "friend x is on signal, want to say hi?" But this is a small marketing price to pay for a good free app. My only suggestion for improvement is make group texting easier by allowing the user to start a group text the same way you start a text with a single recipient. Stock messaging in iPhone and Android have accomplished this, I'm sure Signal can do it to make this a 5 star app.

	   Useful. Easy to use. Seamless integration across Android and ios. Now that SMS messaging is gone, why tie the user to a phone number? Plausible deniability is gone with that method. The use of a phone number needs to go away for the security of users.

	<comment>
	   Signal is currently the best secure chat client available for people who care about privacy. If you've ever wondered why that's important for us citizens and why there's a constitutional amendment (the 4th) that guarantees we're protected from invasive search and seizures, just watch the Snowden movie to get an idea what the spooks have up their sleeves and how everyone is being targeted.

	  People who have deleted the app need to unregister their # witch makes it a pain for people who still have the app to text people who've uninstalled signal. Switching between secure and "unsecured" text is total bs, it should be an automatic preference. If it wasn't for these problems I'd rate 5 stars.

	   I know someone who lives in a cell service desert, whose only chances of outside communication is through their landline or their iffy internet connection. She was given an iPad and was delighted to be able to text other Apple owners without much issue at all, but was frustrated at her inability to text Android users. A lot of apps that work across both operating systems are questionable, but this one is decidedly the least offensive when it comes to privacy and security. It works beautifully as well.

	   I like that the app incorporates sms so I can use it as default. Only issue so far is sometimes has problems with mms. Downloads some pictures, but not others. LOVE the dark UI.

	   I've been consistently impressed. Importing conversations doesn't work with groups, but once you've set the app as default, group conversations work fine. Currently my only wish is that more people used it, so that everything could be encrypted. That's not up to me though.

	  So far so good, but I would like to suggest that when inviting people via sms if you could either let us write a message or put something about what the app is, that'd be great. My contacts thought it was spam because there was not really a description, just the name of the app and a link.

	<comment>
	   Could really use some touchups to resemble a modern communications app more than a sms app from 5 yrs ago (like less wastage of space in the message bibles so that more info can be gleamed with a single glance, read receipts etc). Also the desktop Client is horrendous when compared to what Telegram and Whatsapp have.

	   It'd be interesting to add cryptographically anonymized tweets to this, or a way to send a private broadcast to all Signal contacts. As a replacement for Samsung-packaged SMS on Credo over Sprint, Signal works great.

	   I turned off Samsung text messenger app and use Signal as my default. For my privacy-aware friends I have them switch to Signal too. Also, educate your friends about supporting Open Source projects. Whatsapp and FB even use the Signal encryption protocol to keep your messages private (but they track other things so don't use Whatsapp/FB/Google messengers if you're a Privacy advocate).

Las llamadas por VoIP, a pesar de ir cifradas, en general, tienen una buena calidad con un consumo de datos reducido. Se puede usar simult谩neamente desde PC como aplicaci贸n de Chrome/Chromium.

	   Want to point out a couple of issues I've recently faced using this as my default sms app. 1.) It automatically add's +91 (India code) in front of any number I try sending a sms to. This breaks it as alot of banks etc are special numbers where sms fails if +91 is added in front. And provided there is no option to remove the +91 is a deal breaker as now I cant send sms to that number. 2.) When I tap on a number in a msg can I not get an option to send an sms that number in addition to just calling him?

	   Don't uninstall to try to upgrade the app, you'll lose all your texts..... Other than that, Awesome app. I'd give 5 stars if it didn't have the constant nagging share suggestion every time I start a new string. Even when I do or check it, it still comes back if the recipient is not on Signal. Not a deal breaker yet, but not 5 stars bc of it either. ***Update 3 months later, I've now decided to use WhatsApp. They're making constant improvements, and now have video as of 11/15/16

	   Can you please allow a more user friendly interface in terms of accessing media sent and received. And the allow last seen of the person we're texting. That's the two convenience bordering on essentials to us users. Great work so far team!

	   Intuitive and simple! Keep it comin! Better iOS and Android communication would be great. Wonder how RFS might help all this. Does RFS support encryption, non natively? Also my call function doesn't work, have to force close app after every call to make another. Gets stuck on blue white screen and does nothing. Oh, and when I end a call, bluetooth gets stuck on phone call, music doesnt go back to playing. Been looking at the github, constant progress, love the eloquent code :D

	   Decent app to replace SMS on the phone. The major issue is that if your contacts stop using signal then you can no longer message them easily. You have to long press the send button for each individual message to change how the messages sent. This is a real pain.

	<title>Loved it, but MMS messages won't download (Verizon Note 5 AND T-Mobile GS6)</title>
	<comment>
	   Loved the app. It's quick, easy, secure, and all around what I was looking for. However, the deal breaker for myself and my girlfriend was that neither of us could receive MMS messages, whether it was just a group message or media. I tried a lot of fixes suggested but nothing was able to get it working, unfortunately. Moving back to the terrible stock messaging app for now.

	   Alerting people who have me in their contacts that I am now using Signal is a serious breach of privacy. Also, the app continues to vibrate after I have deselected the vibrate option in notification settings.

	<comment>
	   I am a long-time user of this app and Signal is a great, easy-to-use encrypted messenger with continually expanding features that has a very good reputation amongst the FOSS and privacy-concerned communities. I have just a few requests for features to be added: (1) a doodling feature like is available on apps like Wire or iMessage, (2) encrypted video calls, and (3) the ability to like or edit messages already sent. I would be interested in knowing if OWS plans to implement these in the future and when.

	<comment>
	   I gotta say one thing...that i bet the developers of this app or server officially cannot see the messages.. But unofficially I can bet on anything that developers definitely have a way (backdoor or something) to read every secure message u say.. But that's okay.. Cause if i invent the app, even though i say its completely secure and i can't read users messages..i can't not put a way to see the messages.. It looks complicated.. Maybe you don't understand my point..

	   I'm 99% sure I'm completely satisfied with this app, over satisfied even. I just want to ask one thing to know for sure. Do both parties need the app download or does only one side of the party need it downloaded for the messages to be secure? For example, could my messages be unsecured if I sent an SMS to someone who doesn't have it downloaded?

I tried to uninstall and reinstall and the only thing that happened was it told me my phone doesn't have service or signal how are you going to create a message system free encrypted important messages and then not be able to send them?

	   It's a great app, but it doesn't turn on my screen when I receive messages. I know it might not be a critical feature, but it is one that I like and find very useful, so please at least add the option to turn on the screen upon receiving messages! Other than that, a great app!

	   Sometimes Signal doesn't always notify immediately of an incoming messages. So far it has been between 5 to 15 minutes later and I will get a received chime and popup and the message even though the received time on the message says it's been received earlier. Messages fail to send frequently as well.

	   Anyone who doesn't see the need for encryption or consider their own online life is open for all to view deserves what they get. This app protects your messaging privacy 100%. Would you really hold a offline private or sensitive conversation in a public place where anyone could be listening in??? Of course not!!!!!!.....

	<title>Can not send messages</title>
	<comment>
	   At first everything was ok and app was working fine, but after some time it stopped to send messages to some of the people in my contact list, especially ones who has signal too. I have tried reset secure session and uninstalling but no success. Do not spend time on this app, either they should make app working or do not make it. As there will be situations when you need urgently send message but app is not working, sorry bug. It is not answer. Overall idea is good but developers lack to hear users is bad.

	   Convincing non-technical folks to use encryption is an uphill battle as anyone in IT knows. Signal is the first communication app that offers encryption in an easy to use way. Furthermore, it coexists nicely with other messaging apps should you need to run more than one.

	   This has been a very good app for sending messages anywhere in the world. Do wish encrypted message's were such with each text sent and not just encrypted to others using this app also. I'll give a five star rating when every text is encrypted.

	   It is a very good app with end to end encryption of messages. But message delivery is slightly slow. Hope it will be resolved soon.

	   Group chat can be awkward because you can't easily reply to a specific message, but otherwise an efficient & easy to use app. I can't comment on the security aspect, not my field of expertise :-)

	<comment>
	   I love the app. I love the security, I love how customizable it is, and almost everything about it except for the fact that picture sending and receiving is absolutely atrocious. Images look horrendous in signal. I actually had a friend of mine ask me to email pictures to her instead because the photos that she receives from me are of such poor quality. My brother is currently in Hawaii and I'm considering getting rid of this app so that I can actually appreciate his pictures for what they are. It's sad.

	   Phone has a few issues on Android like sometimes it can't keep a call and when integrating it as your main texting app it erases messages. It keeps its self open sometimes and actually locked me into a group making it so I could not reply or get out of the group. But, in general this app still has my trust and support as they do continue to improve.

	   New to texting and worried about security. I've had no problems using this. I wish more of my contacts used it but it's hard to convince them that wanting encryption is not paranoid, just reasonable in a world where personal data is a commercial entity and profit trumps ethics and morality.

	<title>Great idea why give it all away with no challenge like SMS..this is awesome but nothing is ever truly private.</title>
	<comment>
	   I think it's a great idea but nothing is ever truly private but step in the right direction for sure just because the massive data collection going on and this program makes it a bit more difficult for them I mean even if your not doing anything wrong why give everything you do over to some server in Utah or Pennsylvania

	<comment>
	   Everyone knows that Signal is the best option for secure messaging. That's why I signed up. I was surprised to find that it also has an attractive and intuitive interface. The user experience is polished and uncluttered, better than google hangouts or facebook messenger. I thought I would have to make some sacrifices in the name of privacy, but the opposite is true!

	  The only thing this really needs is a delayed-send feature, so as to enable recall of a text accidentally sent in haste. I only mention it because I see the developers have an affinity for incorporating good ideas into their applications. ;-)

	<comment>
	   This has replaced my default text message app. If you use the password feature, all messages on your phone are encrypted. If you are worried about man-in-the-middle and contacts use the app, in transit messages are encrypted with zero-knowledge. An open-source app that protects your privacy and now has self-destructing messages. It is like Wickr, WhatsApp and SMS all rolled into one.

	<comment>
	   Old reviews below. - - - I love this app once again. The failure has disappeared. - - - Recently it was quietly failing to send my messages. Their support while reasonably fast, could not offer any help. -----&gt; When you send a text to someone you expect that only the person you are sending it to will read it. This app is one of the few that guarantees that. Most others don't. Plus, this app is working as well as or better than others I've used. Five stars!

	   I only got signal because my friends with signal were not getting my group texts. Im sure it's great for security but it kinda forces others to use it. Not to mention that now my friends withOUT signal now cant get my group texts. Just annoying...

	   Only problem I have with this app is it will silently fail to send/receive messages from secure contacts when a data connection is not available. I would like the option to fall back to regular SMS when data is not available (with a prominent warning of course)

	<title>Great app for the texting</title>
	<comment>
	   It's great that standard SMS is supported as well as the secured communication. The calling features between two people with the app aren't great, but it's free and a secure connection, so it's a trade-off. Took off a star for the so-so calling features, but overall it's a great secure alternative to Apple or Android stock texting apps.

	   There are a lot of well-marketed encryption solutions out there, but what most don't know is that these are generally not very strong, nor well-regarded by cryptography researchers. Signal is the real deal. The protocol is well-regarded and publically available, and considered a model when new standards for encrypted communication are discussed. I've read the spec and believe it to guarantee that both the servers themselves cannot read your messages, and that the client can prove they've been delivered.

	   No complaints. I would like some more customization and maybe the ability to change vibrate patterns. When the app is locked the Chrome addon can still be accessed. I think that needs fixed.

	<comment>
	   I got this to encrypt messages, and it works great most the time. Sometimes though the messages get delayed, I'll get them anywhere from 5 minutes to an hour after they're sent. Or the same for the messages I send. Doesn't matter if I'm on wifi or data. And the calls aren't that great. They often cut out or drop. But for the most part it works great for what I need.

	   As easy to use as any messaging app, yet totally secure. Your messages are highly encrypted and to end , even stored encrypted on your device and only unlocked with your passcode. Your messages are never stored on their servers , so they can't be hacked. Get it for those private messages in your life.

In my opinion with the two mentioned features, it will lead this app to one of the most used messenger worldwide!

	   I wish you guys would add an ID feature to signal, sometimes strangers want to message and talk to me, but i can't give them my phone number, a safe way for this would be to give them my ID on signal and they'd message me without ever knowing my phone number. Signal is a great app, i hope it evolves in future as much as possible. Thanks.

	<comment>
	   This app rules. I've been plagued with MMS troubles for years, but this sends them like they're regular texts, and has a great delivery report, too (just in case). The UI is beautiful, but amazingly, the app runs ridiculously fast. Only request is a way to see message count. Everything else is perfect.

	<comment>
	   Message transmission when the cell signal is weak has been improved. The time for a message to be sent has been greatly reduced ("stuck" messages). Still, best results (sending/receiving) are obtained when you are in an area with good or great reception.

	<comment>
	   I'd love floating shortcut support for my Android 7.1 devices, and to be and to stop all the "invite x to Signal" messages by default - I invite as many people as I can anyway, but it's annoying when using it as your default sms app.

	   Needs skin-tone emoji support (not everyone is pasty white) and a better draft highlighting - a different color would be perfect. Otherwise a good product that will get better over time.

	<comment>
	   Signal it's great when you have to chat with only one person. But when you want to chat in a group it's quite messy because you can't reply to a specific message, you can't tag someone when you're writing and there is no way to format your message with styling (italic, bold...). So just a few things to do to make it the best messaging app ;)

	   I switched from hangouts, this is just a vastly better app, even before you consider the transparent encryption and out of band capabilities. I just wish it was better than Telegram. Needs better group chat like Telegram's channels, support for sending files, tablet support and video calling.

	   Love the app, its clean interface and simple usage. One thing that's not so obvious, and a lifesaver that took me a while to find...when you need to message someone who is already a "signal contact", but one of you doesn't have data atm, you can long-press the "send" button to switch back to regular SMS mode.

	<title>Privacy or Reliability, Not Both</title>
	<comment>
	   As simple as that. Signal seems to take privacy to the point of deciding I myself can't view some messages sent to me, tossing them down the memory hole, never to be retrieved. I could somewhat understand this as a rather aggressive security measure, but only if the app deigned to let me read what I'm sent first. A glaring flaw in what is otherwise an excellent, indispensable tool. Also, it'd be nice to have a few more colours to choose from.

	<comment>
	   This app has two issues 1 i can live with and one I cannot. 1) Messages won't send over WiFi. 2) when delivering messages the phone sometimes give delivery error messages that seem to be untrue. In my own testing the issues seem to be that the the app doesn't play well with iMessage. The Debug system they use can't capture the issue so for them it doesn't exist. Their answer is to turn off notifications for all message so I never have delivery confirmation. I say fix the app. They say no.

	   There are only 2 problems with this app... The first problem is that it is not the default app on every phone in the universe. It should be and everyone should be using this. The second problem is that there is no widget that tells you how many messages are waiting for you. Even the default Android SMS app has a widget. Add a widget to this app and you get 5 stars.

	<comment>
	   Installed without a hitch. Now all my texting goes via this app, and if the other person also uses Signal, texts are encrypted. No need to fuss around with setting up keys or passwords. Easy!!! My only complaint is that incoming secure messages are in a white font on a light orange background - really hard to read. This is the same regardless of whether you choose the "light" or "dark" display theme. I want either light font on dark background or dark font on light background. Give me some contrast!

	   Forget everything you have used, these guys should be used to describe privacy on messaging apps in the digital age. Every time they have a new feature, I find more and more reasons to use Signal. Great job guys!

	  The app is pretty easy and simple to use. But what bothers is that you have to send all videos and photos one by one, same thing happens while opening pics sent by other people....clicking one by one to look at them.

	   An app devoted to privacy but notifies your friends who also have signal that you got it too as well as notifying you when people in your contacts also sign up for signal... So much for privacy. Notifications are annoying too

	   I downloaded this thinking it was a way to send encrypted sms. Whilst it may be that I can't send a message unless I have some form of internet connection. So I haven't been sending real sms messages this whole time? I think the app is slightly misadvertised. That being said I think so far this is closest to imessage android has had as far as I know.

	   Bottom line: Signal is the best texting app for privacy available. It doesn't have all the features of the other apps available; but let's be honest, none of those apps offer the same level of privacy and well-designed security practices.

	   Great app for standard sms texting with the option to send secured messages for anyone else who has the app. I've used this and Textra and I think I prefer the security options for this app over the customizability of Textra. The dark theme is very easy on the eyes.

	<comment>
	   This is way better than the one that came with my phone. I love assigning different colors to each contact, and I FINALLY have the ability to start new paragraphs within my text messages. I used to have to type them in a note and then cut/paste if I wanted separate paragraphs in one message. And of course, I'm very pleased that this app encrypts my messages. The only things that would make it better are emojis and GIFs. :)
