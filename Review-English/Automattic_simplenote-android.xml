	  Greatest app for notes, most beautiful, easiest, simplest, lightest. I would really like if there was some improvement in the tag editing: sometimes I go to edit (tags) , because I want to delete some created by mistake, and the moment I push the trash icon it just had rearranged the tags and I delete another tag and there is not something like a question prompt asking me if I am sure for example, so I miss something to be there. Yet it's the greatest app for notes for me. Thanks again for the great work.

	  It's the best simple cloud note app in the store! The few teething problems from the interface update a while ago have all been sorted very fast, great work! 1 other small thing i noticed: On android 5.0+ the status bar is light grey which makes it hard to see the white status bar text and icons in most lighting conditions. Maybe simplenotes' shade of blue would work better? Cheers

	  Hi, I really like simplenote but one thing I really want is to show the view mode by default. The list is also shown in edit mode which does not look quite good. We have to just view it and edit if needed, it is the natural sequence. Please, I request you to enhance this behaviour and make our favourite simplenote best. Thanks

	  Nice,simple note taker but notes use abbreviations which the spell checker can't handle elegantly. Please allow us to turn it off. Auto formatting of some words containing special characters eg: / is also unhelpful. EDIT: (after reading the developer's response - for which many thanks) my device has spellchecking disabled - it doesn't seem to make any difference to Simplenote which spellchecks regardless)

	   Still the best and only getting better, however, the "Edit tag" function does not show the correct amount of entries for each tag, at least in a huge library like mine (1200+). They also do not synch very well between my tablet and cellphone. For example, I need to delete a given tag from both instead of doing it just once, which would be the expected behavior.

	<title>The perfect Writing app</title>
	<comment>
	   Perfect for when you need to focus on writing. This is not one of those bloated writing apps with everything but the kitchen sink. It's light, quick, well designed and available across devices - what a writing app needs to be.

	   Why don't you allow users to organize the tasks in folders? To change fonts? Colors? Sync with Google drive as other apps does. If these r done I think it is gonna be simply perfect.

	  Much better than the bloatware called Evernote. How hard can it be to make a simple note sync app? Edit: No problem :) Windows version also syncs proper now.

	   The design is fantastic and it's the simplest form of a note keeper app. But I'd like to drop a suggestion to add more functions to long pressed entities. As of now you can only delete and send it to the top. Add a password to a particular note from the long pressing feature would be nice.

	<comment>
	   So far as the name goes, it's a simple note taking app but where it stands out for me is it's cross platform capabilities. I use it on my mobile as well as laptop which makes it very easy for me to catch up on things. The only thing as of now I wish is if we could add reminders for certain notes, that way we won't miss important tasks.

	   Now this app is really good but ever since I updated like 2 months ago, it has been totally useless. I wish I could attach a photo. The lines keep moving up and down (sentences), the line spacing changes and sometimes two lines can fuse into one. I mean don't you guys use your own app and test it after an update? Geeez! Would give it a 5 star after this is fixed as well as automatic saving. I think this error started after the 1.5.1 update "minor fixes in layout and font changes". PS: I am using an S6 Edge.

	<comment>
	   Now only is possible to search from outside the notes, useful when handling with big notes with information. Enormous battery BUG. It keeps the radio activated all time. 5% of battery without using it. The dark mode is dope, but an amoled/pure black mode would be huge.

	<comment>
	   Great app but notes missed a simple feature which is a protection from being accidentally deleted. It is good that we can go back and restore from history, however a star next an important note will prevent it from being deleted and wapped from history after a certain period of time.

	  I Lost my phone today, but I ain't really tripping because it was a cheap phone anyway, BUT what I was worried about, were my notes and ALL my ideas I wrote in Simple note. Thank the Simple note Gods for saving ALL my script notes and million dollar ideas. Really, this App is super dope and I never had to hit the saved button once. It took care of all that for me.

	  Uninstalled because notes are hidden from user on the system. I don't want to use your syncing service, I have my own which would work just fine (and is infinitely more secure and private) if only the notes were stored in storage as any regular software on any os besides mobile would do. But no gotta be difficult.

	  Simplenote is a solid, lightweight alternative to Evernote. I've used Evernote for years but was starting to find it annoyingly sluggish. Simplenote is lacking some of Evernote's features, but it does what it does well, and it's fast. The UI is nice and simple. I also like that I can pin a note to the top of the list for easy access.

	<comment>
	   I use this app because if you accidentally delete something you can go back and restore it. Countless times I have lost all my notes in Google Keep Microsoft OneNote etc. Unfortunately your notes only allowed text no photos video recordings audio recordings drawings. But it is quick to open and I'm able to jot down notes quickly. That's all that matters. Overtime that's the exact reason why I've switched from the other applications which have more features. *Add the ability to set a reminder in the app.*

	<title>Two changes could make this the perfect notes app.</title>
	<comment>
	   1. Full cross platform Markdown support. Not much use if it doesn't work everywhere. 2. Full open file access with options to sync across Dropbox, Drive, Synthing, etc. and note encryption. Frankly, having the apps open source and forcing users to use your proprietary sync service across your own servers just comes across as suspicious. What do you have to gain when your apps are open and free anyway?

But unfortunately when I created my account here, I have lost all my notes made here and I am just left with 9 notes. I am not able to understand where my remaining notes have gone.

	   App doesn't sync properly between Android app, desktop app (Win 10) and web app. Some notes missing in desktop app, can't sync it. Pretty frustrating.

	<comment>
	   Simple and just what I needed. Updated: Still working great. Just that the pin lock in the latest update can only lock the app when it's closed (cleared from memory), I'll prefer it works like previously.

	<comment>
	   Is it possible to add a setting that allows you to tag notes and take them out of the "All Notes" category. I'd rather just have important notes there and save less important notes in other places.

	  Pin lock got fucked up. Even though new update got it back to work.... It now gets locked only after I clear the app from my recently opened list. Shouldn't have updated it in the first place. Worked fine before.

	   Have been using as a replacement for Evernote. Got round most of the limitations and was working quite well. Latest update now ignores the pin I set up, and crashes when I try to set it back up. Update: now fixed. Can now use the fingerprint reader on this app, bonus.

	   There's no way to order the tags on android which makes this feature almost useless if you have a number of tags as I do. It's a pity. You can verify this on their screenshots, here in the Play Store.

	   I tried several note app and this is the only one fast enough and with multi platform support. I found a few issues tho. Quite often notes don't synchronise between different desktops and I have to log out and login again. If the same note is open on multiple device at the same time and one of them edit it some weird stuff happens.

BECAUSE it was *SIMPLE* What part of SIMPLE don't you get?!! Now you have to change the name.. How about Complicated Note? or Not So Simple Note!? I still dig it..please just resist the urge to "fix" it any further and remember why it was good in the first place. Please:)

	   It'd be very helpful if the cursor initially stays at the end of the note. I truly hope you add that feature. The various ways of accessing the notes from an account and the classic dark theme make it unique and very useful! Thank you.

	  Need to be able to open multiple accounts. Need to be able to work offline with them both. I could with flick note but it has disappeared ... you misunderstand. I have multiple accounts, business and personal, but with this app I could find no easy way to switch between them. I used to use flick note which did exactly that. I can sign out and sign in to change but then I lose all the notes from the non-signed-in account. Not at all convenient.

	   I've been looking for an app like this for years. Now I've got it. What I appreciate most is that I can use it on my android tablet, on my linux desktop and on my wife's Windows laptop. I can also decide to buy a Mac and I'll be able to use it there. When you are not connected it works off-line, too. If you borrow a PC form anybody you can manage your notes with any browser. What do you want more?

	<title>Unable to paste</title>
	<comment>
	   I have been using this app for a while. I recently upgraded my phone to a S7 edge and now I can't paste into the app. At first I thought it was my phone and then I saw basically the same comment from another user. Not sure why the developers WOULDN'T want you to paste into the app. Now I am an unhappy user, but still a user. I do like the fact that I can put notes in this app and then later pull them up on my desktop. For that, it is still worth four stars to me.

	<title>ADD FORCED REFRESH</title>
	<comment>
	   I have been with this app since the beginning. Through the good the bad the great the horrible and now the OK. This app deserves a fifth star and i badly want to give it. But I will not give it until it has a forced refresh. It still gets stuck and refuses to refresh often. 10/17/16 I'm dropping one star because search functionality is still terrible on android (and bad but not as horrible on iOS). Team. Please improve search!

	<comment>
	   This is an excellent app, it's the best note-taking app on the market, and it's improving every day. Recently, the HTML preview for Markdown! was added, and that's great, but it lacks only one important feature, which is the support for RTL languages to render pages from right time left, it would be great and much appreciated if that option was added.

	   Markdown support is a lifesaver. Although Preview could use some work. Please introduce an option to decrease the font size in preview as well. Edit: Embedded media previews (like Youtube iframes) are displaying an error that JavaScript needs to be enabled. Please enable JavaScript in previews.

	<title>Best lightweight note-taking app</title>
	<comment>
	   Simplenote is definitely the best lightweight note-taking app for ANY platform, be it Android, Mac OS, iOS, etc. I like simplenote much better than Google Keep, mainly because of its elegant clean UI, simplicity of use, instant sync, being lightweight, and being open source. Of course this can't replace something full blown like Evernote, but each has its own use case. I use both (Simplenote and Evernote) in addition to Mac Notes app.

	<comment>
	   Thank you for this great app. I would suggest having an option to add a function similar to OneNote badge for taking notes while browsing or reading PDF files. And also an option to add a shortcut icon in the notification panel similar to COL Reminder for quick access. I will give six stars for that haha!

	  Best Note taking app so far. Simple and quick. It syncs to all platform - iOS or Android, and as well as on the Web. But I think it would be much better if they'll add a feature for a quick note located in the Status Bar

	  Migrated from Evernote to Simplenote. Both the web app and mobile app of Simplenote are faster than Evernote's. As a free tier user, Simplenote's feature is comparable to Evernote and I'm happy with it.

	   I signed in on my simple note app to backup my notes but now all my notes got transfered to the website and I can only see my notes on my phone while signed in. There is no option to copy and paste my notes back to my phone. So there is no way to backup your notes and to restore it to your phone?

	  Really like this application. The only issues I've found are that Markdown links don't work and in Landscape mode the note list isn't visible. If tags in the menu were sorted it would make it easier to find things. Will 5 star this if these can be fixed.

	   I've used simplenote for years and it's great but no new features are being added. I know it's supposed to be "simple" hence the name but it really needs markdown support so you can give structure to documents, the ability to search WITHIN notes, etc EDIT this thing seriously desperately needs the ability to search within notes

	   Instead of wasting your time searching through your notes or being greeted with offers everytime you open the app or having 1000s of ways to put notes, this app allows you to open it type it whatever you need, gets backed up by cloud system, and you can use it wherever you go. Plus the UI is simple, its a fast app, and im using it on all my devices. Keep it simple as many are ruining their apps by making it Word Office

	   Seamlessly syncs across multiple devices, love the simple format, and you can restore your notes to an earlier time (on desktop version, couldn't find a way to do it on the mobile), within minutes. I accidentally erased a note on my mobile (if I had just deleted it, it would be in the trash folder), and I was able to go back 15 minutes and had my note back....lifesaver. So much easier imo than any of the other syncable notes apps out there.

	   I thought I'd finally found the notes app that would serve my needs by allowing me to synchronize notes on my phone and my computer. But I just found out that I cannot paste anything into a note on the phone app! This is a major shortcoming. I'll keep it on my phone for a short time to see if the developer adds this option. ADDED NOTE: I just discovered that, while the Paste command won't pop up on a new, blank note, it will in notes that already have text.

	<title>Huge improvement with Material Design</title>
	<comment>
	   The new injection of Material Design is a huge improvement to an already elegant and well-made app. There are only 2 issues I have: in the overflow menu, where "Delete note" inexplicably appears twice. Also, it would be really nice if Simplenote worked with Samsung鈥檚 multi window features. Otherwise, it's an awesome update and an awesome app.

	<title>No option for customization</title>
	<comment>
	   It's a great app, does all things advertised. One thing that most writing apps give users an option for, though, is ability to change font. I don't appreciate the current font, it's definitely not for writing. You should look into more customizable fonts, and I think it will look much better if you remove the thin lines that separate each note.

	   If I write a string of 5 numbers or more (ref numbers, catalogue numbers...etc.) it automatically turns into a link - I thought a new update would at least give an option to turn this feature off. But no.

	<comment>
	   I know it's unfair to want more features in something built to be simple, but I do wish this accommodated images, synced with Google drive, had alarms, and a better chrome link clipper. Besides that, for simple note-taking it's hard to beat. Though for longer writing, IA Writer is superior, but best if you have Mac for 2-way integration.

	<comment>
	   There is no widgets for fast access to individual notes. It also does not have Dropbox sync and if the Simplenote servers are down, you won't have any backup to your notes. This app also do not allow you to export notes to your SD card so there's practically no backup option at all. Gnotes is a much safer option to store your notes as it allows Gmail sync and Export to SD card all for free and comes with widgets.

	<comment>
	   Best note taking app I've found after Google Keep. Very simple and straight forward. I especially like the simple no nonsense interface both on web and on phones. Just wish they could add support for fountain now that they've added support for markdown. Would make it a lot more useful for writers. Hopefully the app is here to stay this time around now that it has been bought by Automattic.

	   Latest update is a serious mistake, completely ruined the compact interface and notes. Changes to the aesthetic appearance are a step backwards.

	   The app keeps saying to add email address to the tags, but the email address is already in there. Will change rating when it has been fixed :)

	  Nice clean interface, which is great. Using this on both my phone and tablet and there is one annoyance around notes with markdown. It defaults to edit view - I would prefer it to be preview. Even better if this was configurable from the settings. For the tablet the 'markdown' button is next to the delete note button and I accidentally deleted a note. Can this be moved.

	   Best app out there. It is essential to my life everyday. My entire life is contained in this app, i dont know what id do if it went down. Thank you for making this free! The simplicity and functional minimalism is just perfect for me. EDIT: new material design update is gorgeous. Had been waiting for this. It's my most used app. Also the download zip option in the web interface is essential and the best for backing up notes in a universal text format.

	<comment>
	   Love the simplicity. Seems reliable and looks great. Don't bother with text formatting buttons within the app, that will kill the simplicity - just bring the markdown functionality on the web version to this app (options to set a note as markdown formatted and preview the markdown formatted version). Will raise to five stars when the markdown features are added. EDIT 29/07/16 - Raised to five stars as promised now markdown has arrived. Thanks! 馃榾

	<comment>
	   Sorry guys, but I have been using this app for the last 2 years probably and loved the simplicity. Now my list of notes doesnt fit on my phone screen anymore for added padding that has no purpose and the font seems to have changed making my notes less readable. Might need to look for something else..

	<comment>
	   Such a wonderful, simple app. Its great to get markdown support, two issues however 1: when you search a word, it gets highlighted inside the note. It's extremely useful and For me that's the best feature. Unfortunately the highlighting is lost when you go into markdown preview mode. 2. Markdown Shoud be enabled On the notes list screen othwerwise the visible lines will be difficult to comprehend. Also 3. On same screen the verticle space between the listed notes is a bit too much in the current update.

	   The font is much clearer now and the overall appearance is crisp and clean! Love the improvements! Thank you for placing tags at the bottom of the note!! It is less distracting. One suggestion is to allow ordering of the tags in the navigation screen!! I have a lot of tags and it is very difficult to find the right one without the ability to order them. Also, include number of notes in each tag on the main nav screen, not in the tag edit screen. Overall a fantastic update though!

	  Nearly the perfect note-taking app, and I've tried plenty. Markdown support a huge miss on the mobile app, when you have it on the web-app. Definitely needs a quick toggle between edit and preview like the web counterpart, and an option to make the preview active by default -- again, exactly the same behavior as the counterpart. Until then, four stars.

	   Android app doesn't haven't option to create lists, check boxes or a simple text editor like Evernote. Windows app makes it too difficult to use and while I know how to use markdown language, I don't want to be complicating my life to make simple bolds on quick ideas. Windows app does not auto add tags if I have used them before. Good start but is still missing lots to compete with Evernote and OneNote.

	<comment>
	   I tried liking Evernote - really. IMO they are too slow, clunky, and cluttered. I tried liking Google Keep. But I hate their UI - too scattered and flashy for something as simple as note taking. I really wanted to find a nice and simple cloud-based note taking app that I can access anywhere and on any device. Tried over a dozen apps and hands down SimpleNote is the best note taking app in existence. They truly stay true to their name. The UI is simple and easy to use. It loads on any platform super quick.

	  I've tried many note apps, this is a good app... too bad the search function ios is better. When you search a word in note it will jump to that word. Android will need to scroll down to that particular word that is searching... also if can Bold the sentence and highlight the sentence will be great! Hope that will have an update with these features and I will definitely rate this Simple note 5 STAR...!!!!

	<comment>
	   I recently got an android update from Verizon which brought my Samsung Galaxy Note 4 up to Android 6.01 marshmallow. Since then the app does not work and force closes every time. Please send out an update which addresses this issue or I will be forced to change notes applications which would definitely be a shame becouse I really do like this application and have invested my time into taking notes using it.

	   Anything I need or want to do or remember I write it down, and add a tag for easy separating. I love that every feature feels intentional. As another review mentioned I am concerned about the lack of encryption on the servers where notes are stored. I'd either like to see that, or ideally the option to sync to a personal cloud and saving of the notes as .txt files.

	   This app is so minimalistic and really easy to use. Clean, elegant and fast! The only thing I would like to see in the mobile version is markdown support. I use markdown constantly on the web as it helps me organize notes easily. So if you guys could add markdown support in your next update, that would be really great.

	<comment>
	   Well that's just it. I really don't get it how you could have made such a beautiful app for the iOS, and yet such an ugly one for android. In particular, check out the odd fonts, the weird size choices (none of which look normal), uneven spacing between the notes, text underlined red even while reading etc. Seriously, just look at the iOS version and redesign the android app already)

	<title>Sync is the best. No checkboxes.</title>
	<comment>
	   It's available on many platforms including Linux and they sync instantly. Search is fast and even highlights the search term in the note, something even Google Keep doesn't do. This app doesn't allow checkboxes though, meaning you'll need to come up with innovative ways to manage ticking off items in lists.

	<title>An important flaw and a few minor issues</title>
	<comment>
	   Important: notes are stored unencrypted in their servers. Really?? In 2016?? There is no valid excuse for this (they claim there is, but not really). The minor issues is the lack of support for rtf (fonts, tables,...) and small attachments (images, etc). So a nice and fast app but only 10% as useful as it could be and a very unsafe app to store things that matter.

	  Strongly recommend Simplenote. I was looking for a replacement for the IOS note app. This runs on all my platforms, is fast, the sync is robust and automatic, and the app is fast and light. Does what it was designed to do VERY well. Exactly what I was looking for. I did copy/paste and brought in all my IOS notes. I use it to share notes with my family. A great app !!

	  Good simple note taking app. A few things changed would make it even better like the Tags should be in Alphabetical order, as it becomes difficult to find the tag otherwise. Secondly When I copy and paste an article, then try to make changes in a paragraph the size format automatically becomes small and does not remain same. Please try to correct this.

	  Keeping it simple - that is what SimpleNote does. I have previously had paid subscriptions to both Evernote and Diaro. Later I found Evernote to be cumbersome and costly. While Diaro was more affordable, it was buggy. Finally, I have migrated my note-taking to SimpleNote. Why? because it is simple - which is what notes are usually about. I like that it synchronizes between various platforms (Web, Windows, Android). Thanks.

	<comment>
	   Please please please add an undo or restore button, the amount of times I've lost something is ridiculous. Sometimes it's because I'll select text and hit the wrong button, paste instead if copy or hit a key, usually while I'm trying to select all the text. Or in the most recent case I hit the home button while trying to select the last sentence and when I came back to the app, everything that was selected was gone. Love this app otherwise

	<title>Waaay too simple, and no background sync</title>
	<comment>
	   Great app if you're looking for simple note taking with no bells and whistles. Tagging notes works very well. Unlike Evernote and OneNote, the app syncs instantly and reliably. However, sync only works while using the app (in foreground mode), and never in the background. So multi-device use cases are very crippled.

	<title>Best Note Taking app. ever.</title>
	<comment>
	   Simplenote is simply the best. I use it on my browser, mobile, desktop anywhere I want. As the name suggests, this is simple to use but not less effective than any other note taking app in the world. Evernote is pretty fatty app and a child to this grandfather of this note taking app. Simply the best. Best of luck, developers. Thank you.

	<comment>
	   This app is by far the best note taking app. The minimalist interface is easy to navigate and features like a night mode give it the advantage in other apps. Was amazed when I found out that the app is free with no in app purchases! Its also a very small app so perfect for those with little storage.

	  Simplenote is one of the best note-taking apps on any platform, and has been for a long time. The ONLY thing I would beg to have added to the Android app is font support, so that I could possibly use a monospaced font and preserve a bit of spacing and formatting.

	  Nice and clean, although I would really love simple things added like underline or bold :P just so I can organize and create agendas better **Edit** -App still retains 5 star rating, big thanks to the dev for clarification! Also, as a suggestion, when a user first uses the app, give a mini tutorial or maybe tell them about the markdown?

	   I expected a lot more from automattic. One device had a problem saving and changes were lost, then the whole note disappeared. Not in the trash either. Hopeless - now I need to get the remaining notes out of simplenote before they are lost too. This app is not ready for real world use.

	   Simplicity is perfection with SimpleNote. It's the quickest way for me to write on my tablet, iOS phone, and web browser on desktop. Syncs beautifully. Hopefully this is here to stay.

	   Most simple and elegant note taking app on Android, with only essential features. Sync works well too. Edit. Can you please add a feature to take out notes.

	<comment>
	   Well somehow simple mean easy. What I think is, why don't U just show the word counter so we can see it everytime and delete icon instead of hidding them on a menu. Tapping those menu everytime is wasting time. And why I can only share the document one by one? It's not simple at all. Seriously Dev.

	  This would be a 4 or even 5 star app IF IT DIDN"T RANDOMLY DELETE NOTE CONTENT. You select a note that previously had tons of data you'd been compiling over a week and POOF, it's BLANK! No explanation whatsoever. From reading the comments, I realize others have encountered the same issue. This app WOULD BE PERFECT: fast, easy to use, intuitive, fast sync, ubiquitous sync to all devices and the web. BUT...it loses note content!!! :( Given that the whole point of notes is to preserve information, this app fails its core function in the most unpredictable manner and hence becomes absolutely useless. What a shame.

	    The syncing is seamless! And the tags system helps me organize my notes better.. But can I request for an option to sign in through two/more accounts in the app? Please? I want to be able to switch between my different accounts without having to sign out from one to sign in to the other each and every time... Can you add an option where we can simply switch between multiple accounts? :) That would be very comfortable. I'm willing to pay for that option too!

	  So far, so good. I was an Evernote user for many years for basic notes and stuff to keep. Had about 100 different notes saved. Recently jumped to Simplenote on my Note 5 running stock 5.1.1. It's everything I need so I copied all my notes from Evernote to Simplenote and deleted the Evernote app from all of my devices. Suggestion: how about the addition of a basic text editor (ie: bold, underlined, italics, highlight, text size, font)? That would put it over the top.

	<comment>
	   This app is perfect for those times when you just don't have a pen and paper handy. Simple and easy-to-use. While I would not recommend relying on this to store passwords or business reports, it is perfect for everyday notes. If you are looking to store passwords or business reports, there are other apps for that.

	<title>BEWARE: Simplenote Android app still duplicates notes and loses data</title>
	<comment>
	   I keep hoping that some version of simplenote will make synchronization reliable. It's better than it was in 2013-2014, but still makes duplicate copies of notes, which makes it easy to lose data by editing the wrong one. It hasn't been right since they went to Simperium sync years ago. They keep issuing updates, but core functionality is still buggy. Also, there's no Undo function in the editor. What century is this?

	   Good speed, aesthetic needs a little update, like font choice and what not, but overall, Simplenote is a really good no-nonsense app. The only thing I miss is colour code and reminder (funnily enough, I really thought Simplenote has reminder). Oh and widget will be awesome too :)

	   Solved my problem syncing my on-the-go notes between OSX laptop and Android phone. You can also treat individual note titles as tasks to build your own research workflow/to-do list by adding custom code such as "qqt" to help you recall from search menu. Anyone know the typeface/font used in this app?

	   A bright blinding white screen apears when I open or come back in app, even if I'm using the dark theme (which could be much darker). A full screen when writing or reading notes would be good, for more simplicity. The top toolbar takes too much space, it can disappear when not needed.

	  Very good and use it often but one problem i have noticed and i think its to do with having a lot of stuff in the notes or loads of them is that it randomly copy and pastes some words in a different part of the note when i delete or enter space/shift down which as you can imagine takes away what ever ive written in some parts and replaces with what i intended to write or delete. Pretty sure it has nothing to do with keyboard and doesnt happen on any other app. But otherwise best Note app on android by far

	<comment>
	   There's times where I open a note then all of a sudden it's blank. I then exit the note onto the home screen of the app and select the note again but it goes blank. This is really frustrating and it's happened twice. I'm considering deleting the app if there isn't an update to fix this by the end of the month

	   I've been looking for in a note trapper. The dark background + text color make notes pop. Tags, markdown support, time stamps are grande, too. I do wish the app offered more text editing/formatting options, i.e. bold, italic, font styles, text blocking/indent, bullets, folders - to name a bunch. As a full featured text editor, this already elegant app would be the best & only one of its kind! (I've been searching a very long time!) I hope it plans to grow beyond its simple design.

	   I'd like to know that it saved as soon as I shared to it. Sometimes I feel like it doesn't save unless I pin it. I'd like to be able to share to it and press back to exit to the previous app instead of being taken to the notes list. That way I can quickly share, know it saved, and then resume working.

	  Can't argue with the name - it's a minimalist app but does what matters and does it well (been using it for at least a year now). Very refreshing after having tried Evernote and also a basic text-files-on-cloud approach. This is a really good middle ground. Would be nice if there was automatic background sync (without having to launch the app) and an option to archive old notes or hide certain tags, but it's no deal-breaker and I think this is definitely still a 5* app. Long live Simplenote.

	   It's so quick and easy. notes are opened in edit mode and saving is automatic. Unlike more complex apps like Evernote where you need multiple clicks to open, edit, save, and set the title of a note. The sync is awesome and the web app works great. I usually write some notes on my phone and then check em in my browser when I get home.

	  It's really simple and fast to use, but. I've encountered multiple times very annoying bug on one of my notes. What i did: Opened existing note; Selected one of Rows of text; Pressed "enter"; Entered value; Pressed Enter again - result: Simplenote app hangs. After i open my note in the app, it hangs again. Opening the note in web-browser- it returns representative rows of my note, long as maybe 100 000 rows...

	  I've been using Simplenote for so long that you can actually track the last six and a half years of my life through the 700 notes that I've written during that time! love love love this plain text editor. use this if you need a no-frills note-taking app that syncs smoothly between all your devices. Feature request: iPhone app has the ability to retrieve previous versions of a note, would appreciate for android

	  UPDATED: I started looking for a note-taking tool, comparing this one to its major competition like OneNote and Evernote. Just the idea that they are at that level is cool! It is simple to use and elegantly designed. However, I've come to believe that I need the basic Undo feature to correct mistakes when I'm on my Android, which makes it risky to use (again, only if I'm on Android). What it does it does incredibly well. I would definitely recommend this Application. Update: I will need to check out the Undo / go back a revision on the web!

	   This app may not be an "evernote" but it does all the functions that it is supposed to do.. i.e take notes and store them. It does this simple function very effectively..plus the app is very stable too... thats why 5stars.

	<comment>
	   Useful app, so such a shame that on mobile when you go to add another item to your list/note and start writing, the cursor jumps to where you don't want it and so you end up erasing previous notes without meaning too. It seems to basically do a cut an paste job when you didn't ask it to. This happens a lot so is very frustrating when you're trying to manage a list/cross things off/add things etc. Needs to be fixed asap or else I will have to stop using the app.

	  This app NEEDS AN UNDO BUTTON. I've erased entire paragraphs by accident because of the glitchy cursor placement, and they're completely unrecoverable in the mobile app. UPDATE: Thank you to the developers for alerting me to the note history in the web app, but please add some sort of undo and/or note history to the mobile app as well.

	   There is no functionality to concatenate notes for the purposes of printing/sharing. For example, searching for "goals" may bring up all notes tagged "goals" but you can only select and print or share one note at a time. You need to be able to share or print a group of them together. Perhaps you want to be able to send your boss a list of all the different big tasks you completed towards your goals.

	  Dangerously buggy I've used the app for a long time and I really want to like it, but it sometimes just wipes out notes for no reason when you click on them. They can be recovered by going on the web app online and using the history feature (not available in the app), but this bug makes it impossible for me to recommend, and NEEDS to be fixed ASAP. Another feature that would be a huge improvement is rich text (bold, underline, italics, bullet points).

	   The app deleted my first and only note during normal use. Dangerously buggy, this makes the app unusable for me. What use is leaving a reminder if I'll never see it again? I might as well write it down on paper and then burn it. Actually, I think I'll stick with that in the future.

	   The app was pretty good until it suddenly deleted an important note without permission. The note is not in my trash and I am unable to restore it. Poor customer support online. Will be using Google Keep from now on.

	<title>The Best Notetaker App</title>
	<comment>
	   I've tried many notetaking apps and Simplenote is by far the best one. It is simple to use and navigate, uses minimal space and memory, and syncs flawlessly online. The best feature? The ability to pin the most important notes to the top of your list of other notes. Brilliant! Would however suggest the developer add the ability to Bold, Underline, and Italicize text.

	<title>No consistent syncing</title>
	<comment>
	   It only syncs when it feels like it and there is no way to manually initiate a synchronization. It's never synced when you need it so you have to deal with stale data most of the time.

	   It's a fairly good app, but one thing it lacks is a manual sync button. Oftentimes I'll write something with it, and wonder if and when it syncs with the cloud, as sometimes I'll have one version of my writing on my app, and another version on the desktop. A manual sync button would eliminate guesswork.

	  I love Simplenote's service especially for the simplicity (save the lists, pictures, etc for Evernote), but the Android app is ridiculous. Text overlaps with next line and the only way to fix it is to close the file then reopen it again, every single time, and this happens in all 3 of my Android devices.

	<comment>
	   There is nothing more infuriating than trusting an app with your data and then having it ALL DISAPPEAR. In this case, blame it on Simplenotes' clumsy interface. There are no instructions nor obvious interface elements that indicate how to actually SAVE your note. Consequently, it's extremely easy to lose everything you just typed. Even if you pinned it. "Goodbye SimpletonNotes"!!!

	<comment>
	   The name of the app speaks for itself. It is plain and simple. The interface looks great on Android too. Syncing across the Web and iOS devices are incredibly smooth. I would like to suggest more font size options though. The "small" font is too small for the average smartphone screen. Meaningful animations and transitions will make this app perfect.

	<title>Nice App, Glaring Issue</title>
	<comment>
	   I really like the app and would like to give it 5 stars, but there is a glaring issue that has been simply overlooked. When using this on my tablet with a keyboard attached, it is really hard to be able to focus on the writing with that pencil icon always in the bottom right. I will be typing and then think that I may have mistyped the word, but I cannot read it because it is hidden beneath that icon. It would be awesome if the icon went away if you're not actively touching the screen. I would assume that is what would happen as other applications hide the buttons when you're not actively trying to press the buttons. It kind of takes away from the application itself, at least for me. I would be using this on a daily basis, but I think I am going to have to find an application that doesn't stop me from being able to read what I am writing. It's such a small thing, but it really takes away from the writing experience.

	<comment>
	   This is a very nice app for easily taking text-only notes (no formatting). I like the tagging system, which would be even better if tags could be nested (hierarchy). Preview of notes in the list is better here in the app than on the website. An archive feature would be nice as well, so as not to clutter the list but still be able to access old notes. However, I really, really, really don't like the font they have chosen for writing the notes and it's not possible to change it.

	   Killer feature is accessibility on a desktop browser as well. This works great for quick, no-frills note taking. Those asking for more, perhaps you want EverNote or OneNote. Not something named SIMPLEnote. The quick, lightweight feature is what I love. Plus it is free. Amazing.

	<title>Why no copy to clipboard button?</title>
	<comment>
	   Beautiful app but one thing I cannot understand is why a text note app doesn't have a copy to clipboard button or even a share button (in mobile version) on the main list? Otherwise would have been 5 stars.

	   Finally, a nice-looking note app that has tagging feature. It already replace the bloated Evernote for me. Can you please add checklist? It can useful sometime. Also, it will be perfectly perfect if there's a widget ;)

	<comment>
	   I love everything this app provides. The few minor improvements I'd look forward to are proper user synchronization as it didn't carry over my notes from my previous phone although I created an account for that main purpose. Also an undo option or a way to have backup copies from previous writing sessions would be amazing as it has frustrated me when I write over 3 paragraphs only to have it all erased by an accidental backspace attempt which instead of erasing a single word, erases the entire note. 4*stars

	<title>Idea Organizer</title>
	<comment>
	   I use this a lot to organize ideas & thoughts begging to be captured on my notes. The tags let me classify my notes easily but I noticed they're not alphabetically sorted. I hope it'll be included in future updates. I would also love it better if there's some level of hierarchy for better classification aside from tags. This would allow me to switch between specific subjects with its own set of topics organized into tags. Think of it this way: notebooks with its own set of tags, within a notebook.

	   I use this mainly for school work between my home computer and tablet able to easily continue from anywhere. Very simple app but does what i need. The only problem i have is when it doesn't always carry over notes,i thought this was because it wad still in my tablets recent list but not open so computer edits aren't saved but even closing it fully it still fails. That is the only problem i have that needs to be fixed, otherwise will like this app

	<comment>
	   To be ranked as 5 star, it needs some more extra features like folder management(it can be similar to Google drive), check list, user preferences for sync management, search by tags etc. It also need some UI enhancements, for example a little bigger passcode number pad, proper visibility difference between notes in list. Hope new updates will be there with enhanced features.

	<title>Best Note-Taking app. On any platform.</title>
	<comment>
	   Light. Uncluttered. Fast. Instant Sync. Possible to view past versions This is no bullshit note taking app, and it truly delivers. If you want to save photos, scanned notes, or record audios and playing widgets, there's Evernote for you. But for you who just need to write down important text notes, which you can look up for whenever you want, offline and online. No app is doing it better than Simplenote. Combine it with its web app, and the third party app Resophnotes for Windows. Your note taking experience is complete and seamless. I'm also thankful for their top-notch, responsive customer service experience.

	<comment>
	   I love simplenote because (1) it syncs with the web (2) you can share notes with other people dynamically i.e. you are not just emailing or texting them a static copy (3) you can organize with tags - folders would be nicer but tags will do. HOWEVER there is no way sort the tags - not manually and not alphabetically. So the tags are just listed in the order you create them. Please add a way to sort the tags.

	   The developers for Simplenote read my mind in their latest update by adding the two features that I really wanted: a dark theme and the ability to choose a larger font. The app is now perfect for me. That said, I hope that they are not tempted to add any more features. As it is, the app is perfect for me.

	  Simple and efficient app that does what its supposed to do, but this Android version is severely lacking to its iOS counterpart. I as well as nearly all your user base would greatly appreciate it if the developers update the app with Google's new Material Design.

	<title>The best app for plain text notetaking</title>
	<comment>
	   I have been using Simplenote as my primary note tool for 6 years. It has a long history as a stable cloud service! Simplenote is perfect for recording and organizing words. I find the popular Evernote to be bloated. I don't need all the extras it offers. I love the Zen of plain text notes. It doesn't get better then this.

	<comment>
	   Have tried on both iOS and Android - encountered the sync bug / lost notes issue more on Android version - I encountered it more in a few months use vs on iOS w/c I rarely lose notes/have sync issue. Possible this issue is specific to Android version and device. Btw - never saw lost note issue w/ notational acceleration android app, but that one was slow to sync on Gingerbread

	<comment>
	   Been using this app for 3 years on iPhone, Android and web. I love it! It syncs instantly with no probs as long as you have an active internet connection. But if I make changes without WiFi/3G, I used to get sync issues until I figured out this solution, which works consistently for me: if I update a note offline, I make sure to open the note from the same device once I have WiFi again, before opening it on a new device. That way the note on the previously offline device has a chance to sync with the server

	   Inspite of so many updates claiming to fix it, i see no improvements. Text still sometimes repeats itself, also repeats itself in between another line of text. Can't have important data at such risks, i am shifting to something more stable like Evernote.

	  A small suggestion. Consider moving the action bar to the bottom. For people with large phones it will allow using your app with one hand, combined with swiping keyboard. I am using note 2 and consider buying nexus 6, so this is important to me.

	<title>Seamlessly integrates across web/tablet, simple but elegant user interface</title>
	<comment>
	   There are a lot of note-taking apps out there, spanning the gamut between simplicity and feature-richness. Most of them are tailored for a specific type of user, and this one strikes a sweet spot for me. I mostly take notes on my tablet and later, after they have synchronized to the cloud, I organize them and, in certain case, copy them elsewhere. Simplenote allows me to do so seamlessly. Both the tablet and the web application are exercises in simple yet effective design. I very much like the possibility of publishing notes to the internet with a single push of a button, and also the markdown capabilities that allow for putting headlines, bold, italics, links, etc. into documents without being tied into a proprietary binary format like with other word processors or rich text editors. The tag-based organization structure takes some getting used to, but it's definitely a more extensible way of organizing one's notes across different themes and associations. I've searched for a good note-taking app for years, and now, it seems, the hunt is over.

	   Lacks certain important features..like basic text formatting options(the default text layout is sometimes annoying), a to-do list for tasks and also, Where's the widget?!!? I get that it's 'simple'note but these basic features wouldn't change that... Looking forward to updates..

	   The best version of Simplenote was version 3.2.5 on iOS. The Android version is hit or miss. Sometimes the syncs don't make it across to other platforms, or the note will become garbled. Wish list: version history, grabbable side scroller, night mode, and ability to return to last edit point.

	<title>Sync issue workaround</title>
	<comment>
	   Great app, but sync issues. When I edit the same note on Android and web, sometimes the sync is not up to date and I wind up editing an old version. When sync later occurs, I appear to lose text, and I need to go to the web and select an older note version to get my text back. To avoid having to do this, I try to make sure I am editing the latest version when I switch between platforms - based on content alone, as there is no sync timestamp or force sync button.

	   This app rocks! It works across all my platforms Mac, PC, Android, & ios. I love it. Only feature I'm missing is the ability to bold text . Other than that I have been using this app for a few months now and haven't had a single problem. Would highly recommend for when you just need to write something down.

	<comment>
	   The app is exactly what it should be. You can take notes, you can organize them with tags, the UI is very simple, and you can access your notes across devices. Some more formatting options would be nice (bold, underline, bullet points) to keep notes easy to read, but besides that, the app is great.

	<comment>
	   Got this app as it was compatible with my older 4.0.3 tablet that won't support OneNote, and because it offers offline note access - which Evernote no longer supports for free. So this app has a nice niche market in that it has better compatibility than OneNote and supports a critical feature for free which Evernote does not. However, Simplenote does not support note templates, or COPYING a note, and therefore is useless to me. I can understand not supporting templates, but copying... that is so basic I can't comprehend why that don't have that feature yet. Very disappointing.

	<title>Data Entry Problems</title>
	<comment>
	   Almost migrated everything from Evernote to Simplenote -- good thing I just copied over one often-updated text-only note. So I was out doing some errands and had to update the note. Suddenly, the last character I entered (a comma) started repeating across the screen, practically filling about two pages until I hit the Back button. I thought it was due to the mobile data connection, so I turned that off and tried to redo it offline. Same banana. Working via the browser on my PC and ResophNotes are problem-free though. So Simplenote is great overall, just stay away from the Android client until they fix this disaster.

	   DO NOT USE! I just spent I half an hour entering a VERY IMPORTANT note. After I exited the note Simplenote deleted all but the first line. This was done on a Samsung Galaxy Note pro 12.2 tablet. This is not the first time this has happened. I thought the title of this app was called Simplenote. Now I see that there is a MAJOR DEFECT with this app. Am going to use Samsung's Snote from now on.

	<title>data loss, notes not synced, improperly formatted</title>
	<comment>
	   i was working on some notes for the past 4 hours and my notes are not synced across my devices (macbook, ipad, nexus 4, nexus 7). a few that did sync are not properly formatted or seem to repeat the content several times over. and i tried to sign-out then sign-in again on my device and the notes that existed locally were not gone too. for me, this app is not ready for primetime/production use. use at your own risk...

	<title>Don't use it on Android - it throws away your notes or scrambles them</title>
	<comment>
	   I just made a note this morning. Then went to look at it on my Mac, and it isn't there. Went back to my 4G Android tablet (always online) and it's gone from there, too. Poof! No more note! Other times I've had it scramble notes. Don't use it! This is on a Verizon Ellipsis 7 4G Android tablet running Android 4.2.2. It works good on my Mac running Mavericks, also good on my iPad running iOS 7. But I can't trust it on Android. ** update 6/18/2014 ** I just reinstalled it on my Galaxy Note 3 and my Android tablet. A note I had taken, that was updated, showed as updated on the phone, but not the tablet (it was, and still is, updated on my Mac). Later I checked the phone, and the "update" had been removed. Grr. The whole point of this app is to seamlessly keep everything in sync, everywhere. It totally fails at this. Looking for an alternative.

	   UPDATE 6/1/14: STILL having issue with recent text disappearing on timeout. which is very unfortunate. their solution was 'just use SN on other platforms for now' like 3months ago UPDATE: AGGGH! This issue was fixed briefly after the update, i started trusting it again & its continued--i have now lost HUGE blocks of text/work. Was my favorite most used & reced app--*Have NEVER had ANY issues bef: jst switched to Android & EVERY nav away note(lockscrn, home, etc.)= ALL RECENTLY TYPED TEXT DISAPPEARS.

	<comment>
	   It's nice to use an app like this on the computer, my tablet, and phone. I work day to day on the PC and have a habit of using notepad.exe... Unfortunately those text files aren't synced to the cloud and can sometimes be lost on my desktop of icons. I really don't like Evernotes UI, it feels complicated and cluttered. I use to use QuickNote by Diigo, but since they pulled their app off of Firefox, I've had to flee to another app! Thankfully Simplenote is maintained by Automattic; a company I already trust!

	<comment>
	   I've used Simplenote for years, since the beginning when cloud-synced notes were a new thing and I wanted the notes on my device backed up and easily accessible on my computer. However, now this app is basically useless because it doesn''t keep my notes! It occasionally wouldn't save the last few words from my edits, but this morning I worked on a note for 20 minutes, and after I switched apps, my note was reverted to two minutes after I started it (I was connected to wifi the entire time). I've liked this app for a long time, but it's time to switch to something that is dependable.

	   I've used Simplenote on iOS for quite some time. The Android version continues to eat/mangle what I've written with some very buggy behavior. This never happens with iOS; no more. I'll only use it on the Apple devices now. At least that way I will be guaranteed non - trashed notes.

	   What I like the most is that the title goes into the body, not wasting space in fancy functionalities. You just need to start typing, that's what you do in real world notes.

	<comment>
	   I had rated it five stars before but there is a glitch that makes this unusable for me. I posted before that notes seem to vanish suddenly. I even did a complete reinstall of the app. This time around, I was writing a long post, and looked away to think. I had every intention of doing a copy before hitting the back button in case my note vanishes. My screen times out and I immediately pressed my power button. To my horror, only a small fraction of my first line existed. I lost everything else.

	<title>Some major bugs</title>
	<comment>
	   I switched to Simplenote from Apple Notes because it is cross platform. The application/service as a whole is great, besides the lack of rich formatting. But on my Galaxy Note Pro, the app exhibits extremely buggy behavior. Sometimes when I open a note, one or more phrases that I typed in my previous session will be repeated over and over in the note. Other times it completely disregards any of the changes I made, and I lose a half hour's worth of work. I haven't been able to verify this but it seems to only happen in landscape mode. I don't know if this is just a problem on the Note Pro, but I really hope it's resolved soon. In the meantime, I'll be copy pasting my important notes into new notes as a backup.

	<title>Ghost Notes not fixed</title>
	<comment>
	   It created 62 blank notes on its own and wouldn't delete them. There is no option to select all notes so I selected them one by one and then selected delete.There were 42 empty notes left. I selected them one by one again to delete, there were still 35. I'm not doing it again. Every time I opened a note it created duplicate tags as if adding a comma makes it different. Too bad, I thought it would be a good app. Uninstalling. Wordpress app is awesome, though. I guess I'll make a private blog full of notes.

	<comment>
	   I use it on Mac and rely on it for all my writing drafts and making notes. I'm changing computers soon and just laboriously moved everything from Simplenote to Evernote before I realised that Simplenote saves all my content automatically to my account and that I can also sync across devices and access my data on my phone. Love it. I agree with the other people though about basic text formatting - bold, italics and bullet points would be appreciated.

	<comment>
	   UPDATE: Simplenote used to be the epitome of the "one thing well" design philosophy. Sync my text notes! Now notes fail to update on nexus 4. PREVIOUSLY: I was heartened to see a fix come out for Samsung devices but I still have no search bar on the galaxy tab in landscape mode after updating. Sync on the tab has also been an issue so we will see if that improves. I love automattic and would love to rely more on this app. Also, six digit numbers turn into links of some kind. Again, only in galaxy tab.

	<title>Cannot Undo; sync error and sometimes don't sync; no manual sync button</title>
	<comment>
	   Simplenote is a great cross platform notes system, but this android app lacks the essential Undo function. Editing on a phone often involves accidental mistakes, but there is no way to go back within this app. Update: I downgraded to 2 star, because the sync problem--as many reviewers have pointed out--is increasingly annoying for me. In addition to the repetitive text/note errors, sometimes the android app just don't sync even 10 mins after changes made in other end. So I request a manual sync button.

	   I was one of the victims of Simple Note's Android syncing problems but I continued to use it anyway. For the past week or two it seems to be syncing a whole lot better. Haven't lost any notes recently and note changes appear on the phone right away. If it continues like this I will come back and give 5 stars. Keep up the good work. Really like this app :-)

	   Very clean and simple note-taking app, with an easy to use, intuitive interface. Not many features to brag about, but who needs a lot of features for taking notes? Would like the following features to be incorporated: 1. Encryption of notes for on-line privacy. 2. Basic ability to organize notes in batches/folders.

	   New review:- Have lost a couple of important notes. Was logging details on a call with customer, left the note to refer to another note, went back and all was lost. Has happened a few times now. May have to look for another app which is a shame. WIll have to revise down to 1* as this is a massive problem Old review:- After paying for the abandonware Flick Note, and being forced to pay for the new version of Epistle, there is finally a descent Simplenote app. Needs some more polish though. - A clearer list view. The current view is a little cluttered - Night mode / sepia mode as in Pocket - font size , font chooser - Swipe actions in list view to delete / share. - I would like to see number of notes n each tag in the tag view - have a combined list / note view in landscape - the ability to swipe through notes in note view. - hide the header bar when scrolling down a long note

	<title>Looks great, but synchronization issues</title>
	<comment>
	   When it works, it works really well, especially the search-as-you-type. However, synchronization kind of happens when the app thinks it should. Often I open it, and then I have to wait for an indeterminate amount of time until simplenote decides it's time to sync and I can then finally see my newest notes. A "sync now" button would help greatly.

	   When it works, this is everything I want it to be. But when it doesn't, and jumbles up all my notes, on phone, tablet AND desktop, well then that is more than a little annoying. If / when this is fixed, full marks for me. Until then, nope.

	   There really should be more options for free note taking applications you can share/sync with others. Simplenote is one of the better options.

	   While it has a nice UI and it works some of the time, YOU WILL LOSE DATA. 2 stars just for the concept and simplistic UI. P.s. you should also do a dark theme.

	<title>Android app works great; no problems with sync</title>
	<comment>
	   Update #2: 2/6/2014: It appears that SimpleNote can't sync, it gets caught in a loop and eats my battery. Restarting the phone and it syncs pretty quickly. Update: 2/6/2014: I have now experienced a sync issue -- I edit some text on my phone, and then look for it in the browser a minute or two later and it has not updated. Neither refreshing the page nor closing & reopening the app force a sync -- and there is no way to force a sync that I can see. ------ I have not experienced any sync or data loss issues with this app and the web app and have tested it multiple ways. Can someone who is post some steps to reproduce the problem? I wish the app let you swipe to the right while in a note to go back to the list of notes. But other than that, I love this and the web service (except for lack of keyboard shortcuts).

	<comment>
	   You can use Simplenote (from Automattic, Inc.; developers and creaters of WordPress)to write short notes, medium-length poems or top 10 lists, or loooong essays or articles. All texts can be found in Simplenote's main document list. Everything is furthermore synced to other devices that support Simplenote. You can tag all text documents with single words you feel describe them, so you can search for the tag words in the future. Simple GUI, functional design - great app.

	   Tag names are not being edited. There are many bugs in this app even after many updates. Also, many basic note making features are missing in this app. The idea and UI are good but very poor execution.

	<title>Using Glance Note Instead Until They Stabilize the Syncing</title>
	<comment>
	   Researched. Rejected these: Evernote ... not all of its notes are available offline. SpringPad ... no way to backup your notes. Google Keep ... no way to backup notes, and no tagging. So I decided to go with simplenote. It didn't have photos or audio notes, but I value importing and backing up much higher. The web portal for it is also pretty good. Everything looked good until one day I noticed that it was repeating chunks of some of my notes, sometimes 10 times -- when viewed through their web portal. And then about a week later I noticed that it has also erased some of my content. So, about 2 weeks ago, I began using the app Glance Note, which accesses your Simplenote data online. I figure I can keep using it until Simplenote gets their app figured out. It's not as nice as simplenote ( it takes two taps to edit a note, and tagging is clumsy), but so far, it hasn't messed up any of my notes. And that's what I find most important in a Notes app. Hoping these guys get SimpleNote working well!

	<title>Back to Evernote</title>
	<comment>
	   I'm an Evernote refugee who was attracted by Simplenote's promise of a clean interface and rock-solid sync. And the iOS and OS X apps deliver on that promise. Unfortunately, even over multiple update cycles, the Android app on my stock (non-rooted) KitKat Nexus 7 loses note data constantly. The steps to reproduce are simple: Start writing a note, then switch away to another app or to the home screen. Upon returning, more often than not, you'll find that a portion of the note (sometimes a large portion) has been lost. Gorgeous app, but one star for not being able to master the basic requirement of retaining my data.

	   This app needs little improvement in common sense, when I minimze this app and return, it will show me top side of the note instead remembering last position. Annoying.

	<title>Sync is broken</title>
	<comment>
	   I've lost a number of updates to existing notes, had to clean up notes where added text was duplicated multiple times and had 30 copies of an updated note created which had to be cleaned up manually. Lots of wasted time for something that should be saving me time! I switched to simplenote from a Dropbox based solution and for a few months it worked well. But I suppose it's time to switch back.

	<title>Use Minutes Text Notes rather than SimpleNote</title>
	<comment>
	   I switched from Simplenote to Minutes Text Notes yesterday. Simplenote has lots of sync problems in the past 2 months and I finally decided to give it up. Minutes is great in the design on my nexus 7. On the Mac, I use nvALT to sync with dropbox to access my notes. The dropbox files are backed up using Time Machine so I have no worry! So far Minutes serve my needs very well. The best feature is the in-note and title search which auto highlights all results.

	   I love simplenote, and I really wanted to like the Android version too, but it is just not reliable. It continually mangles my notes so I have to go to the web app and restore the previous version. It's lucky this feature is available or I'd be way more than just a little annoyed and disappointed.

	<title>Widgets in sight?</title>
	<comment>
	   The UI is great and I like that it can be used across both my Mac and my Galaxy S2 but having widgets for Android similar to the ones available in GNotes would make the app much more useful for me.

	   After trying out Evernote again, I quickly switched to Simplenote. This app is only 1MB, opposed to Evernotes 27MB and loads really fast. Also there is no restriction in sharing like Evernote has. The only thing I miss is markdown support in the mobile app.

	<title>Can't sign up with the app from my Acer Iconia A1-811.</title>
	<comment>
	   Trying to sign up for an account with the app produced an error: "Can't sign in with that account." Trying to create an account from the website now produces error:"That account is not available." Update: OK, could complete sign up from my laptop. So the problem seems to be with the app from the Acer Iconia A1-811 or with Android 4.2.2.

	   Used to be great but has serious bugs lately. Note content disappears, note content gets repeated (sentences repeated 20 and 30 times within a note). These bugs make the software completely unreliable and untrustworthy. Searching for an alternative. Man, do I miss Catch Notes.

	   Just installed SN on my android. OK. But how do I get it downloaded to my PC? The only choices on the website are for phones. I want to sync notes to my PC and have an icon on my desktop for easy access. I don't see any way to do this. I signed up for an account already. No help section? No users forum? I'm stumped .

	   Don't use this for important notes. Or any notes that you want to keep, come that. Spent ages making a huge list of things to buy for Christmas - presents, and ingredients for many days' of meals - on this. Went on to website to add a few things and only 4 items were there. Went back to this app and sure enough, everything else had just disappeared. Hours wasted. I couldn't recommend this at all. Going to give Google Keep a try instead.

	<comment>
	   The name says it all. This is like sync-able version of mobile notepad. But why not add feature like bold, italic, etc? I think that is arguably the basic function of a note. Anyway, nice and fast app.

	   Since MS refuses to release a proper One Note app (web apps don't count) this is the best solution I found for syncing notes between Android, and OSX. It's clean and fast, maybe a little too clean. Having folders to organise notes would have been nice. Also only a Web app for Windows, no desktop app :-(

	<comment>
	   I hate losing the things I write. There's no way to force save. You just have to wait and hope that something got it; a noncloud notetaking app with exporting is more reliable. This is a pretty fatal flaw for a notetaking app, but is still my favorite cloud-note keeping method for its barebonedness and simplicity (just don't forget to at least meet the basic needs of what notetaking needs)

	   Simple is an understatement. No location stamping. No dating or scheduling. In short nothing more than notepad saving to a Dropbox file imo. If there are any other features which would make this more than a plain text editor then I missed it in the instructions. As a plain text note taker it meets the very basic requirements but there are oodles of apps which do that better. Not least google tasks or Plain calendar. After them diaro and others.

	   I used to have Catch Notes to sync notes to my computer, but since it closed down, I moved to Evernote --too bad Evernote didn't quite fulfill my needs and stopped using it altogether. But this app! It syncs perfectly! Albeit Catch has spaces for your notes and stuffs such as photo notes, but when you have tags and sync across the web, I'm a happy camper :)

	   I like the way you can pin notes to the top. I like the Tagging system it works great! I like the way the search function, works across different tags so you can find your notes instantly. I like the way it sincs with my Mac, I device and two Android devices almost instantly and perfectly. As of December 2 2013 it works fine with KitKat installed on a first generation Nexus 7. I just hope the developer doesn鈥檛 start trying to add options and features and bloats it up. Please Keep It Simple

	   This app is perfect for those who want a no frills, light minimal note app. I docked 2 stars coz it has bad sync issues with their OS X app. Adding a note on my phone has no issues. Syncs well with the mac app. But if I add a note or edit on my mac, it refuses to sync wt my phone app. Double work for me :(

	<comment>
	   Even under the 1.1 KitKat fix, notes I deleted on my iPhone were still present on my Nexus 7. I logged out in hope of forcing a sync and now no notes show. The main reason I went with Simplenote was the cross-platform sync in a cleaner package than Evernote, and it's disappointing I can't trust it. :-( The app doesn't seem as smooth as on iOS either, clearing the trash was instant on iPhone vs watching notes disappear one by one on the N7. Would love for these issues to be fixed and if so will update.

	   Desperately needs a dark mode! Pretty sure my retinas are permanently scorched after opening this app when I was in bed. Otherwise, great note app. Really easy to use. Online sync is very nice. There is a slight delay for new notes to appear on phone if made online first. Faster than Google Keep. Uses tags only, no folders. Would like to see folders added in the future. And please, please, give us a dark theme.

	<comment>
	   This is really annoying - I spent a lot of time writing a long note, but hen I open Simplenote after an hour or so, my note is totally scrambled!!! Instead of my text, I have some words and lines repeated several times, everything else is broken. Definitely it is a sync error that should be fixed! And this error is repeated often, it seems that if your data connection is lost during the sync, it kills your note. Look at my last note - I spent an hour thinking and writing it! Now it looks poetic: Lessons Three Invite everyone's friends Public circles circles circles circles circles circles circles circles circles circles Compact center Go steady Hold the arms Go steady Hold the arms Go steady Hold the arms Go steady Hold the arms Go steady Hold the arms Go steady Hold the arms Go steady Go steady Go steady Go steady Go steady Talk more Go ge

	<comment>
	   Simplenote is as its name, a simple and easy application to take notes with immediately, with no distractive frills. It even gives the user the option to organize those notes with tags, and syncs the changes immediately. Sadly, it does not offer much in ways of export options. I find that a simple text option is very cumbersome. I prefer Word documents and PDFs. Would it be possible to offer those options?

	<comment>
	   Update: Wow you ask for an update an in just a few hours you get a fix. Thanx guys, glad to have this app back on my home screen. It's time for a new update guys. Just got my Nexus 5 and after entering my info at the sign in prompt the sync wheel just keeps rotating and never syncs. I have deleted and redownloaded the app with no luck. I really like SimpleNote as I use it on all my other devices. Just hope you can update soon.

	<comment>
	   Thanks to great quick Dev response this now works with 4.4 on Nexus5. Used for years on iOS and awesome to have it on Android. My only complaint is that notes used to open up where I left off, but in some recent update it changed to always open at the top of the note, leading to lots of scrolling. If there was a setting for that behavior or it went back to opening to the bottom of my note it'd be 5 stars.

	<comment>
	   I started using this for all my plain text files. The syncing and search are great. Plus there's an API, so there is a whole suite of desktop apps if you don't want to use the web interface. I love Dropbox, but for plain text I'm happier with Simplenote.

	<comment>
	   There is a fine line between simplicity, and being lacking, and SimpleNote just doesn't cut it. I suppose it's fine for those who have one idea in mind, NOTE TAKING. But in any sense why not use Google Keep? This app isn't even good to look at, it is so simple. I'm sorry, but not my cup of tea here!

	   I really like Simplenote, but this app feels very beta. Syncing is BAD. Notes added on my GS4 don't appear on the web, changes made on the web don't appear on GS4. No option to force sync or set a schedule. really needs work, guys! Great looking app but functionality is poor.

	   It is really simple note taking app with good synchronizing. I would like to see rich text formatting in the premium version with some feature like numbering, bulleting, leveling, bold, italic, and etc.. Widget is needed to add note quickly right from the home screen or even add a note from the lock screen.

	<comment>
	   When I try to install the app again on another device, all the tags do not appear automatically in the left panel. I had to open a note remove that tag and add it again to solve that problem. There should also be an option to add checkpoints instead of just the simple text so that different points are distinguished.

	<title>So Simple, theres no options - simply lazy</title>
	<comment>
	   yes, the product is simplenote. yes, its super, uber clean. yes, the syncing is actually pretty terrible. (one week, hasn't synced yet) yes, there's not even a sync option to set ANYTHING. LAZY. Ive been trying to replace the glorious catch app. i still use it on my phone/app, even though syncing is now broken. And its still MILES ahead in usability. I think the devs are using the simplicity as a cover to not do anything with this app. Its so seriously benign, that its stunning that it can be called an accomplishment. PS- in all honesty, once the sync didn't work- ever- its a wrap for this app. No excuse for this lameness in this age of app, and when evernotes and springpads, etc are out there. heck, even apples note app is better. PS 2- wheres the 'quick note' widget? Oh, too simple an app to actually have one...what a joke.

	<comment>
	   Second time I use the app, and I'm halfway into an article I'm writing, and Simplenote loses it. I'd been working on it for nearly an hour. Didn't sync during that whole time to the site? Didn't save in the app? My wifi signal was fine the entire time. I don't like relying on automatic backup only to have it fail. Emailed Dev, got reply, said they'd look into it. Never heard back.

	   This sounds even less secure than Google, post-NSA revelation. Read the TOS before using. Why can't it just sync at home? Why does everyone love the utterly insecure, non-private, "cloud"?

	<comment>
	   Finally, an android app from Simple Note. Much better than Flick note, glance note, etc. Fast sync and search without any extra clicks. BEST MULTI-PLATFORM note app if you do not need extras like Evernote. Worthy successor to Palm Memos. The notes does not show up in google now searches for phone content. Same notes in notational accelaration android app do. Please add searchability by google now in future versions! Still 5 stars. Nothing comes close in simplicity and elegance.

	<comment>
	   I'm a Simplenote fan, and whenever I need an example of the perfect app, I'd use Simplenote. But now I find a glaring bug -- if you simultaneously edit a note on the iPad and Android, the earlier edits are silently overwritten. So your shopping list will mysteriously miss some items. This used to work perfectly a couple of years back.

	<title>Sync?</title>
	<comment>
	   This app does sync periodically, but I can't for the life of me figure out how often it does. There are so many times I've started a note in the app and wanted to finish on a real keyboard, only to find that the note is not available on the simplenote website nor in my desktop client. For the love of god, put a force sync option in your app! If you are totally against a force sync option, please at least put some sort of option in the settings so we know how often it's supposed to sync (every 30 minutes, every 4 hours, 4 days, 4 weeks?)

	   Long delayed, but finally here. Interface is clean and simple, but needs to add access to the Markdown bit and Markdown preview, which are currently only available from the web interface. Bulk operations like tag management or deletion would also be good, as well as importing text files from the device to Simplenote.

	   I love the Simplenote service. (I'm a premium subscriber.) The app is perfectly usable, and it syncs great. However, it's not as customizable as some of the other unofficial Simplenote clients available. I would like the ability to change color schemes and (especially) font size. I'm sticking with FlickNote for day to day use, but I'm interested to see where this official Simplenote client goes.

	   I was ready for this to be a crummy iOS port. Initially, it had issues with sync & battery drain, but after emailing Automattic, they responded the next day that those issues were fixed. Simplenote has no note length limit (unlike Google Keep) and the web version supports Markdown - the canonical method to format text without dealing with a rich text editor. Sync is nearly instantaneous, and I use it for a combination of lecture notes, as well as minor tidbits of info I might forget. It handles both tasks perfectly. If you're looking for a great cross platform note taking solution that's lightweight, this is the app to go with. It's a cross between Evernote and Keep, but one that keeps the best of both worlds.

	   I'm so glad that this project doesn't seem to be dead and that new versions for new platforms are being released! However, I would love to have Markdown preview like on the web version and the ability to do a multi-tag search, which is a feature that doesn't exist within any version of Simplenote currently. That and as many people have requested, a widget. I know this is an early effort and will get better over time, I look forward to seeing that development!

	<comment>
	   Loved simplenote on iOS and the android app is nicely done. But it has major battery issues on my moto x. Once you launch it it drains about 10% per hour unless you force close it. I'll update my review once this is fixed. It also doesn't seem to happen on my HTC One or Nexus 7 2013. 09/13/2013 - Version 1.0.1 fixed the battery drain issue. Updated review to reflect 5 stars. So happy there's a first party Simplenote app on Android now. Thanks!

	<comment>
	   A good start; needs a little more functionality like seeing note properties (created, updated), delete without opening, etc.

	<title>Good UI. Needs more functionality</title>
	<comment>
	   Good clean UI. Will be great if it has the ability to add images to notes. Also would like to have checklist option to strikeout tasks completed. This app has great potential. Also consider having a pin/pattern lock to increase privacy.

	   This is an  app, it's simple enough. I'm uninstalling though cause it doesn't offer anything different from other apps. My current favourite is Google Keep.

	   I have just started using this app. Its looks simple and nice to use. Although I have been using Evernote and Onenote for taking notes but it seems that I can use this app for some categories of notes as well.

	   Thank you for an official Android app! My only two requests are (1) a widget, and (2) the ability to adjust the font and font size, similar to Flick Note (which has now been replaced on my device thanks to your official app).

	   All note apps should have a widget. Widgets are one of the things that makes Android great.

	   But I think maybe a little too late. Have been using Keep and Evernote. Don't see how this will fit in. Nevertheless still an impressive app.

	   Great app, lovely to use although I would like to see better image support. I would love to use this as my standard note taking app (goodbye Evernote) but the lack of image support just isn't doing it for me right now.

	<comment>
	   I use to use Catch notes until it shut down, and had to move to evernote which is way too ugly and complicated. Then simple note arrived! Thank you so much for having an import tool from evernote so i dont have to retype it all (again!).

	   Created an account but got a massage saying error. And despite getting a welcome email, I can't log into the app with the credentials. Tried to reset the password on the website, but the confirmation page wouldn't load. Fail. Uninstall.

	<comment>
	   Why aren't my notes syncing? And why isn't there an option to force sync? None of my notes from the iOS app have shown up after I've logged in. Until this is worked out, 1 star from me.

	   Nice and clean app. Just missing a widget like Google's keep one, to fast note taking. Beside that, everything fine.

	   But seriously, no room for improvement on the app? 5 stars across the board? I like the enthusiasm, honestly. I have used the app, and only for a day so far, and I'm glad that it's better than all the "simplenote compatible" apps out there. Are you guys going to be adding a feature for sharing/publishing to the web from your phone and optionally emailing a link? That's pretty handy and I always enjoy(ed) doing this in the iOS platform when I needed to share information quickly, and then remove it once I knew the party had copied the needed information. Yes, I know the share option is there, but it still didn't allow for publishing the actual note and leaving it published via that link that others can connect to later. I still have to do that from the web, and that's a convenience I'd rather have in the app. There are 3 options I would like, since I have a ton of notes and the convenience could simply be added as a future option, or set of options. 1> Alternating row theme, as a settings option. 2> Highlight the search section on a per-note basis if enabled in settings. (Call out the sentence with the word(s) you searched for) 3> Tap and hold to [un]share/publish/delete, etc.

	   I, like many others, have been waiting for a long time see an official Android release and I am happy to see that it works like a charm and perhaps could even replace Evernote as my go to note app.
