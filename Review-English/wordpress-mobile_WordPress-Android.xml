	  I like the app, but if there was a way I could write subsequent post on a particular post and make it appear as one post I'd really appreciate it, I don't know if that will change when I purchase a plan but i intend on doing that soon

	  This is indeed a great app. It only received a 3 star because there is no dedicated gallery button. That would be much appreciated and welcomed to the next update.

	  I love this app but there is one important function missing from the previous version. Read More function is missing, this means that a lengthy article will be displayed on my homepage except I visit a Web browser to shorten it. 5 star if this is corrected.

	  Shifty. Account made through the app doesn't match passwords when trying to log into WordPress. Creating a post from scratch is extremely limited within app. Waste of time just go to website.

	  Only problem is how it always disconnects from Facebook. Every once in a while, I have to go in and reconnect it and it's annoying. I'd appreciate it if that bug or whatever gets fixed. Other than that, I am satisfied.

	  Great app! The only thing that needs fixing is the "Local changes" message. Just because I open a post via the editor, doesn't mean I edited anything. The message should only show if I actually made changes, not just because I clicked "edit."

	  I love this app. I've never encountered any issues and although I blog infrequently, the bulk of each entry is usually written on my mobile during an opportune moment of inspiration. I'd use it more if I posted more, it's straightforward, well laid-out and presented. It may be my favourite app.

	   Why the Featured Image feature is not working? I set a photo as a featured photo, but when I try to publish it on my facebook, other photo came up as featured photo. I did all troubleshooting I could possibly do, but still the same. It's annoying me.

	<title>Deletes posts at random as you write</title>
	<comment>
	   Twice now I've spent an hour writing a post, on a crappy edge connection (while on vacation) and then it deletes them. At random. No explanation, no way to undo or see a previous version. Utter trash. Needs a local database that saves different versions as you write and so when this horrifying problem occurs, I can roll back the post to a version before it deleted every friggen thing in it. Never using this app again. I cant trust it. I've just wasted two hours of battery life on it.

	   Italics uses deprecated "i" instead of "em", and bold "b" instead of "strong", which aren't supported by all the themes. Dashboard was nice. It would be great if it comes back.

	  Good app! Easy to use and follow. There's this sorta bug(?) when I make a scheduled post and try to revert it back to an immediate post though. ;_; EDIT: When I tried posting it as an immediate post, it wasn't showing up in the home page and it says the post isn't found when I tried copy pasting the URL directly to a browser. I had to delete the post and make a new one, and copy paste the content to post it. Hope this helps!

	<title>Could you please add the option for Color font鈥u003c/span> Please add the direct option to color font (ex. &lt; font color="" size="" &gt;Word &lt; /font &gt;) it'll help us directly to change font color. Otherwise app was good however it's RAM usage is little bit large but it's worth it. I LOVE WP Thanks! Full Review</title>

	   "UPDATE: STILL NO IMAGE OPTIONS in the app. No chance to tell it to show a thumbnail of an inserted image, and no option to remove border" It is ridiculous to see how simple and unusable they made this app. Yes, you can edit and add new posts, but there is almost NO EDIT OPTIONS like inserting a pic,you have no option to choose picture size as thumbnail or original,no option for remove picture border.if you have used the webinterface to add a post, and use this app now, the post will be totally different

	   This app deleted one of my blogs I've been working on for a while, which I kept updating regulary. When I finished my blog and updated while uploading photos, I come back onto it only to find theres now nothing there. I try revert and it takes me back a whole 10hours of editing! Very annoyed, what a waste of time.

	<comment>
	   I was continously updating a draft post that I had written when I was working on it on my desktop computer. The updated versions of my post did not transfer to the app which caused a lot of frustrations when I realized that that the post I wanted to update again had been reverted to an older version on the app. The updates made to posts should be automatic and smooth between the app and the desktop verison!! I had to uninstall the app since it's usefless to me in that regard.

	<title>THE MOST RUBBISH, STUPID APP I HAVE EVER USED!</title>
	<comment>
	   It won't let me change my category names. Everything I try to do is unsuccessful and complicated. I have spent ages trying to change to category name and in every help guide online it says to go on "post editor" well for some reason post editor is no where to be found. Absolutely the worst app I have ever used.

	   App works just fine with only wp associated / dedicated plugins like jetpack. Why is there no support for other plugins like Yoast SEO or any SEO used for on-page optimization?

	  This app is so bright it hurts. You're trying to read, write and relax, but the blank color scheme reminds me more of the sun hitting my face at 6am than of me relaxing while browsing. This app doesn't have some sort of front page like imgur has for example, instead all we get is the "discover" feature which only promotes bland, vague and uninteresting posts with no personality. Just look at it right now! Where are the people sharing relatable stories, or video game strategies, or book or tv show reviews or something? All the posts featured there are just... unattractive, to say the least. And it's the only source of new content there is, otherwise you have to look it up manually. There are no set categories or tags, instead you make them up and unless people type them up exactly like you did they won't see your post, which is counterintuitive and discourages finding new posts or bloggers. People can disapprove or even edit your comments. That is twisted, discourages freedom of speech and opinion sharing and even allows people to literally put words in your mouth by changing your original comment to whatever they want. You can't dislike posts or comments, so the voting system is pointless. You might think otherwise because Twitter and Vine have no downvotes, but they promote discovery of new content in various ways, while WordPress does not. The search bar doesn't work. I've tried finding my own posts with the exact same title they have and they don't appear. All of these factors make it feel deserted and lacking of a community, and discourage new users of getting into writing or reading on WordPress. Also there used to be a eay to add a black outline to images; a necessity when the background is white.

	   Turns out the problem was with my Website provider. Thanks to very responsive help from them and from the WordPress help desk it's all solved now. ==== cut here==== I haven't found any way of getting "Local Changes" actually published. Gone through all the motions, chosen "Publish" from the "Publish/Revert" option. Nothing. The app isn't of much use without this...

These free and even subscribed Web builders are difficult to apply Mostly due to memory limitations. ...

	   Wordpress has joined the herd of sheep who think that forcing rediculously complex and impossible to remember passwords, without WRITING IT DOWN somewhere, will make their systems more secure. WRONG!! The wise geeks at WordPress have completely missed how the real world works. I have now written my new 25 character letter/number/symbol password down so that I don't have to change it every time I've forgotten it when logging in. The trouble is now everyone else can see it too. DUH!! Well done geniuses.

	   I really love the App, does everything that I need to get done, but this new update has lost the more botton that I just love, or maybe it's there and I just can't see it. You know the one that breaks a post so it doesn't display the full post on your homepage, where is it? Please make it come back. Thank you

	   It's a good app but I noticed you can't search for old pictures within the app database. You have to keep scrolling down endlessly. It will be nice to also allow some plugins integral to posting articles to work with it. Like plugins for tables or podcasts.

	   Absolut essential features like adding serveral pictures at once straight to a post are missing. Will have to go back to just use the webinterface in a browser. If only i could use the webinterface offline... And why should i allow the app access to my camera to upload pictures from my sd card???

	   App looks nice but to do the main things you need to login in your site, I love WordPress, it's free and open. The app needs functional things. Like a browser to view your site live. And to disable plugins. I also get pages could not be refreshed at this time

	   Thanks to the developer for the response, looking forward to an update with my requested features in the near future. I manage multiple wordpress blogs(more than 50). My blogs serve as rss feeds for my mobile apps. so it's quite challenging remembering passwords to login and then logout for each of them. A multi-login WordPress app will be very useful in handling this issue, as all I'll have to do is sign-in once to each of them and then just switch users when I need to manage another blog. Thank you.

	  Even though I tried this with different keyboards it's editing capabilies are poor. They don't come up to any of the external editors that I have on my tablet. Compared to the pc/web version this is crippled. One reason I would like an external editor is that I have a lot more formatting capability and the ability to 'snapshot' or, for example, undo deletions. rather than sweat coding more editor functions, simply flipping into an more capable external editor seems sensible. There are a lot of management features in the PC/web version that I consider very basic. being able to edit the raw HTML code to correct errors or carry out formatting that the 'visual' mode doesn't permit is one. Again, this might be resolved with an external editor: edit in visual/text or in html switch. Perhaps the simplest demonstration of what's lacking is to run the tablet and the PC/web version side by side. I realize there is a screen real estate issue, especially when trying to run this on a 4.5 inch phone, but perhaps that's a case of "you shouldn't be doing that". However other applications I use do have panels that pull down or pull in from the side. ... out of space ...

	<title>Ah .... what i can say ? The best App ever</title>
	<comment>
	   What i can say, this is the first time for me to use WordPress blog website and I tried other web hosting providers with many plans, but by far the WordPress service is the best service, excellent customer service, very easy to use interface. I'm now on the premium plan. This is the best service ever for just 100$.

	<comment>
	   I rely very heavily on this app to keep me posted about notifications because for some reason, the website doesn't do it as quickly on neither my laptop nor my desktop. But of late, I've noticed, there have been glitches in the app too. Like gravatars of other bloggers get mixed up. I get a notification on my lock screen that I've received a like or comment l, but when I open the app, it doesn't show me the latest notification. There are other too. Please fix these issues.

	<comment>
	   Not only the app. The website logged me out and told me I need a new password so I reset it and it just did the exact same thing. I uploaded one piece and now I can't even access my account. I feel like I have been robbed of my own work. I wish I could write another review because one doesn't show how disappointed and disgusted I am with word press. This is my first day using WordPress and I have spent more time trying to login and reset a password then actually getting to post content.

	<comment>
	   This app has improved over the past year, so I thought I'd re-evaluate it. Many of the issues I had with the older version have been fixed, so I increased my rating to 4-stars. However, it still doesn't meet my needs in that it doesn't work offline. As a nature photographer, I am away from an internet connection frequently and this app requires a connection to function.

	  As a psychologist and educator for many years, I have come to the conclusion that "communication" is one of the most critical things all of us can do in a sometimes unpredictable world. Word Press as a technology has opened my eyes to believing that what I think and say does matter--to someone, somewhere. Thanks Word Press, and keep up the good work. Gerald D. Nunn, Ph.D.

	<comment>
	   The lack of formating buttons makes this app useless. Not having a "remove formating" button is particularly awful. If one logs into this app as an admin there does not appear to be anything similar to an admin control panel.

	<comment>
	   I downloaded the app to write posts offline and upload them when we had internet connection. I wrote 3 posts and saved them as local drafts, the first 2 deleted themselves at different points. It's impossible to load photos into drafts. What should be a useful app is very frustrating and bordering on useless.

	  I'd really love if my blog would open in-app and give an option if I want it open in web view. Also, it would be wonderful if posts didn't appear out of order. It's better if algorithms weren't used.

	   I thought of using this app when I am not near my laptop; I used it to write new thoughts which used to occur at random time. The page in the app, if stayed as draft and if you edited more in your laptop, when you publish the draft, it reverts the page to older edition.

	<comment>
	   Previous version (on my Android phone) wouldn't let me access my Notifications, so I just updated the app, hoping this would help. Now it won't even let me in to my own site unless I click on View External - but then I no longer have access to any options like Stats, edit, etc. Not user friendly, and very frustrating. Please fix these problems! UPDATE: After a "response" and multiple uninstalls, reinstalls & updates, same problem is still there. Can't access my own blog using this app! Useless.

	<title>OK, but drafts vs posts (19 Nov, 2016)</title>
	<comment>
	   Here Samsung J5, Android 6.0.1. I've been using this app for almost 2 years now. I like the design, although a bit 'messy' at times, I still can't view drafts separately from published posts! In iOS it is possible to select posts that are only 'published', 'drafts' or 'scheduled' from a scroll-down menu ... Or is it just me? It makes editing so much easier, especially drafts that have been around for quite some time! Thank you, anyway.

	   So buggy. Rarely loads posts, fails to update posts, throws errors loading post categories, image uploads usually fail. It's clunky to use, the UI seems to be from 1997. Only has about a third of desktop features. I'd gladly pay if someone built this app properly, but this thing's a train wreck.

	<title>Useful but buggy, needs undo feature</title>
	<comment>
	   The app is easy to use, but it is 50/50 whether it will upload photos or not, forcing me to go to the website (half the reason I got the app was to edit offline), and twice now I have been using it when the app randomly deletes half my post. So that's a few wasted hours, and with no undo, draft, or backup feature, I have to go back and rewrite everything I just wrote.

	   Aside from a little functionally, the main editor sucks. Badly. There is no way to use italics or bold because it doesn't float. The improved admin is lacking in functionally. And lately the entire system has had issues on the desktop and app. Updating categories often gives an error that it doesn't exist yet it updates if you do a series of steps. It's kludgy at best and badly designed. It is easier to go to the desktop version and work there than the app.

	<title>BLOG POST GONE!</title>
	<comment>
	   What happened? Everytime I update a post by the app, the entire story disappears. Only the title left. Would you explain this? There have been 3 posts I've updated today and all those three are gone. Of course it will take a hard time to rewrite all over again. Completely ridiculous. This used to be a great app I really love. Please give response. Thank you.

	   Latest version has some kinks though. When text is entered into the body of the text and the post updated either to be scheduled with all the other fields updated, the body of the post is lost on being published.

	<comment>
	   I previously had an issue with inserting images and was asked to contact the support team. However, the problem seems to have fixed itself, so I'm guessing it was an awful internet connection causing it, not the app itself.

	<title>WordPress going backwards</title>
	<comment>
	   Wordpress has taken an app that has been steadily improving and removed the ability to verify links while writing or editing posts. No longer useful and will be headed back to a browser. Very disappointed with version 5.6. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Response to WordPress Support: When I first noticed the change to the ability to use links within the editor section of the app, I contacted support. The change was confirmed and I was told that links will no longer function. Hence one star rating.

	   Wish it had an option to display a compacted list of blog posts, so you can see at-a-glance what's coming up and what's just been posted. Also annoying that you have to add authentication to upload blogs on insecure WiFi. No other app requires this.

	   The app was very useful until updated . Can't find drafts and also can not edit draft. Now the new feed is just in the mess. Instead of showing the lastest post from blogs that I follow like it used to, now it wasn't sorted by time and make it hard to find new posts.

	   Lost a peice I had been working on for months without explanation. Looked everywhere for it, to no avail. I adore the website, but the app is too sensitive and comes off as cheap, and doesn't do WordPress any justice.

	<comment>
	   It's good but I miss the admin options as well. I miss those features when I post a post. For instance, when I hit post it puts all the post together (published, draft, scheduled) why can't it be separated) and why can't I create gifs for a post. That would be nice. I should have the same features from admin as the app.

	   I can access my site and keep track of it very well with this. I guess that was what this was meant for in the first place. To actually write and post content i still prefer to use my laptop because the experience is far smoother that way. But actually keeping track of views and comments and everything is far easier with this.

	<comment>
	   For the most part, I enjoy managing my blog with the app alone. There are some features unique to the web version, which I definitely understand. However, with the latest update, posts in the reader do not appear to be in chronological order with the blogs I follow, and there doesn't seem to be a way to sort posts. The first couple are recent, then there's some from a week ago, and then more recent. Good app overall, but this feature is quite frustrating.

	  The app is amazing as ever but I have two issues. One is getting the same notification multiple times in succession. The other is that the last two updates have removed the word count from the posts in my reader. Would love to have that back. Also, if you guys could add a word count marker in the post-writing section, it'd be terrific. As it stands, there's no idea how long my posts have gone. Thanks.

	   If I click a WP link on social media or on the web from my mobile browser, why doesn't that link automatically open in the WP app in my mobile? That would save my time (to have to log in again on mobile's web browser when I am already logged in on my WP app).

	<title>WordPress is great but the APP is not!!</title>
	<comment>
	   WordPress has been an important part of my life for a while now. Having an app for keeping track of updates is great but the interface is not so good. The app is not smooth or clean. It's very complex with less features.

	<title>Works, But Not When on SD Card</title>
	<comment>
	   (new review, previously one star) Works great, interface seems a little crowded, but gets the job done and is a better experience than the mobile site. Can't get this to run very well if at all when on my SD card, not sure if that is on the app or my phone. (Reason for one star review, before moving it to internal storage)

	<title>Glitchy, not enough features</title>
	<comment>
	   Compared to online , even on mobile, it lacks formatting features. Also, it's glitchy. Sometimes unclicking the number list feature erases the entire note, and sometimes the quotes causes the formatting over any paragraph under it to go far right.

	   On an older version I couldn't get the app to load at all. Since updating, the app is getting better. Now the main issue is sometimes it fails to connect to the internet, forcing me to use the browser instead of the app.

	<comment>
	   A Ctrl+Z or undo feature & Recycle bin for deleted posts. I've had to retype my blog 4 times now because the app wiped it clean twice, the third time I was copying half the story and it cleared it instead. I'm now typing in Google Keep to avoid any further hours lost!!

	<title>Latest updates are very poor</title>
	<comment>
	   Recent updates render the app very frustrating. Copying in text is overriding the style sheets, formatting all jacked up. This app was very clean before the updates and I would joke with iPhone users who had to use alternative ways to handle their blog (like Evernote, etc). Now, I am considering these alternatives because of the poor changes made in this update.

	   All good, but why can't you change font sizes etc in the app? Particularly makes cut and paste quotes look terrible. Even just to cut and paste text match the destination formatting would be good.

	   aside from the awesome layouts and ability to have a blog for free, the app itself is killing me. like seriously, i have to try to log on a million times before the app will recognize my account or even let me into my account. especially after i had to reset my password a bunch of times in order to actually get the stupid thing to let me in. what is the sense of having an app to access my blog on my tablet or cell phone, when i cant get into it even when i am entering the correct information? it shows the login screen and i enter the info, then it goes through and there is another login to fill in, and it happens over and over again. what is wrong with it! please fix it!

	   Does not allow you to login to a self-hosted site. Worse, the forum moderators are not interested in solving this problem. They merely cut off any comments about this problem. Work around: delete the app. Access WordPress with a browser.

	   Can wordpress notify us for new posts which are coming from one blog or list of blogs including non-wordpress blogs. Like in google+. I am not saying about email notification. Also made a bookmarking system so that we can save over favorite blog post. Thank you for this great app!

	   I like the app, it provides ease of access to your site's stats and other things, but I've noticed some things missing. The addition of the add read more tag in the post editor would be nice for starters.

	   Has many of the features of the main site. Easy to use. Frequent updates. Looking forward for more enhancements - one feature sorely missed is feedback. Would love to be able to notify and receive notifications of feedback. But overall, I think the WordPress team is doing a fabulous job. Thank you and continue to be the best!

	<comment>
	   I made a page for a game I play and I love how easy and mostly intuitive it is to use. Its so easy to manage and update content and I like being able to see comments posted without having to actually go to my page. The only down side I have run into is iOS users seem to have difficulties viewing the page and that can be a problem for me as many people in the aforementioned game are iOS users

	   I've been blogging for almost 4 years now and I am so glad I came upon Wordpress. It is convenient and easy to use. When I don't have time to post through my laptop, I used this app for posting and it sure makes everything convenient. I can also see my daily stats everyday through this app without logging on to my computer. Good job! :)

	<title>Broken with last update!</title>
	<comment>
	   I used to love this app, but the latest update has removed the "save" button from the "edit image" screen, meaning I can no longer add captions or image metadata. A horrible oversight by the WordPress team!

	<comment>
	   I used to love and very actively use this app. I went to use it today and it refuses to let me on without entering a pin, a pin I never created and have no knowledge of. I went on the desktop site (on my account) & found no way to set a pin! Over a year of blogging and I'm locked out of my account for no reason. UGHHHH!!! Tried contacting the support w/ no response. This is INSANE.

	   Used to be a good app. But it sucks big time now. I can't upload images. It always gives and error. I'm going to uninstall this app. This would have been very useful for creating a blog while being mobile.

	<comment>
	   So I updated the app yesterday and wish I hadn't. Was happy with the layout showing stats and view site together but now it has moved view site to bottom of screen and has a tab called Plan, which looks like a tool to sell your add ons.

	  Update: Taking the suggestion from dev to use the support, got response: the help support close until September 22nd (today is the 12th) .... Check the error myself, maybe the xmlrpc.php? install the suggested 5 year old plugin, rename the file, still cant, check forum? a lot of the same problem but no answer. This is fresh installed wp ---------- I never had success with this app for self hosted WordPress, two main problem, to login & to upload pictures, always this problem, i tried this app last year, now, the same problem still appear

	   It does not allow me to use italicised words in my title. I hope they will do something. I want to write something about a book I have recently finished but it doesn't allow me to italicise the name of the book in the title of my blog. I want to enlighten people in WordPress that there are times when you might need an italicised title. Thank you!

	<title>Terrible image management</title>
	<comment>
	   This app is flat awful and unusable for a blog with images. First you have to insert a photo into a post to get it into your media library. Then you have to select the same photo to be the featured image. BUT then the post will show the SAME photo twice! So you have to delete the photo from the post and leave it as the featured image for the post to look normal and not retarded. Would be a million times better if you could select a featured image from local library

	<title>What happened to the full editor??!!!</title>
	<comment>
	   Went to create a blog post today using my WordPress app and discovered that the editor is some weird, useless version of what it was before. I can't do anything in it like I can in the web based editor such as indent, center, size/place images, etc....literally every major function but basic typing is gone. Where did it go and how do I get it back? If this is not fixed I am uninstalling the app as it is totally useless to me without the full version of the editor. As well, the web based editor crashes EVERY SINGLE TIME I do an update to a blog. Makes editing virtually impossible. - - - I received an automated response to this review which said, "You can switch back to the app's old editor: Go to App Settings in the app and toggle off the 'Show Visual Editor' option. However, some of the features you mentioned (such as indenting or aligning text) weren't part of the old editor, either." - - - Found the setting. That leaves ONLY the HTML editor and does not fix the problem...at all. And, previously, before this change, the editor in my app and the web based editor were identical in their features.

	  REVIEW UPDATE: Thank's for the feedback and solution. I found the revision in WP Admin and revert back to what I've post and update at PC. This is a great feature to be able revert back to previous work. my feedback: maybe the word update button in the draft or post can be change to save? or maybe, we can have sync button to get the latest updated draft or post either in the web or in our phone, before we start writing. this app can check for the last modified date either in our phone and the one in the server, right? PREVIOUS REVIEW UPDATE: All update and published post that I work on PC was overwritten by this app, click update, I thought it will update what shown in my mobile phone as per what I've done at PC, BUT it upload my draft that I have in my phone.. totally wasted my hour in front of computer.. uninstall it! Might thinking to change other website to start my blog

	  Really not happy. Just typed out a post and scheduled it. It's now vanished and I can't get it back. Also, Instead of giving us useless features, why not allow us to have multiple accounts set up? It's the one feature majority of users need. With apps like wordpress being used for business as well as personal blogs, surely this feature should be essential?

	   Isn't this app used to connect to the backend too, like managing updates and such? What happened to that feature?

	   Won't let me sign into WordPress self hosted accounts anymore. No matter how many times I try. So I have no use for the app unless the issue is solved

	   THOUGH OFFLINE we can save the draft, this attribute is the best. Anywhere, anyplace, idea struck, jot it down, without pen and paper.

	  Updated to 4* after excellent developer response. Will update to 5* after App update...ORIGINAL REVIEW...Can no longer edit OFFLINE with photos included in the latest version on my Androids. You must have an internet connection. I compose most of my photo heavy entries in very remote areas with no internet and save the local Draft until I can connect. This change has made the program unusable for my purposes. Previous version was a 5 star product. What a shame.

	<comment>
	   Overall, the app is great. But the line Spacing in unequal and there needs to be a way to edit it (like in MS Word, maybe) because it messes up the format of the post.

	<comment>
	   Needs more work. The app also fails to load all followed posts. Unless you open it every few hours you can look forward to missing some of the posts that you would have liked to have seen. I loaded my Reader in the app, and compared it with the browser version. In 12 hours I lost 50 posts. So. Useless if you only check once daily. Also needs better text formatting control.

	<comment>
	   I am not sure what happened. On Thursday, this app was amazing. I used it to do work when I was on the road, updating different things on the dashboard from my app. No joke, I loved this app. I manage 5 sites through it. I went to Canada and came back to the states this morning, and now I have to go through the Internet to access the dashboard which means I have to log in every time too. Ugh. This is terrible for someone like me who does web page admin on the go. Big fail, wordpress.

	   I did write a review about the app crashing and looking my drafts the other week. I've got a new, updated phone and got the app. There's some problems that are still in the app as in my old phone. When wanting to add a picture from my phone gallery, most pictures don't show up and they aren't in order so it's hard to find the ones I want. Sometimes, when I click somewhere on a line or in a paragraph to type it selects the very beginning of the post or the very end and not where I click. Thanks

	   I hit Backspace and it does Enter (moves to the next line). I try to select text and the stupid magnifying box won't let me move the markers to the leftmost characters. And what is with that double spacing? I don't know, guys, but this app has become too much of a hassle to use.

	   This is a really good app but I feel like you should be able to know who views your blog. Like not personal info just there username. I know not everyone has WordPress but just for the people who have it. But everything else is fine! It's also REALLY slow!

	<title>Won't let me switch sites</title>
	<comment>
	   I have a site for my class and students and then a site for an organization I sponsor. Everything I try to log out of the organization site and log into my own it sends me back to the organization site. It also won't let me add an existing site. Even tried uninstall and reinstall and it defaulted AGAIN to the organization site. Not helpful at all.

	   I was impressed with big change that I wanted to see for self hosted blog WordPress app. But it is not enough. It also should add justify, underline & heading functionality. Hope it will be included on next update.

	   Wordpress app for Android is best app for mobile blogging. Great Features and UI. But the pictures upload made me feel sick. You must upload pics one by one, unlike the old version that let you upload pics and post with one tap.

	   Often erases posts, claims to have saved them but doesn't. Text will simply erase itself once it decides I've written enough with absolutely no way of recovering it (no fake "save" message this time.) Not sure how I could label this app as anything but useless.

	<comment>
	   I was previously able to view my blog in app on my android but for the last week I can't. Pointless having app if can only see the blog in external browser, as it's too small. Don't know why it's changed but have uninstalled as no use to me now. Will have to update via desktop. Disappointed that WP can't fix this. I contacted numerous times and got no response.

	   I have two blogs and I can't seem to log in both of them. This was not a problem in the earliest version that I used. Now it seems that the option to add another blog is only for a self hosted domain. I've got 2 (dot) WordPress (dot) com blogs. How should I log in them both???

	<title>Great writing interface, loses my drafts</title>
	<comment>
	   I think Wordpress has am excellent clean interface for writing (better than Google Docs or the native notes app). However, if I edit a draft while offline, or I have poor WiFi connection at the moment I click save, my file is lost. I can't even access the version before editing. This means that I can't really use this app (if I'm going to have to make backups in another writing app, I might as well just do it there).

	<comment>
	   When I change my phone to Oppo F1 Plus, I did not receive any verification code by sms (if I login with apps) . If I login from website, Everything is okay. And then, I turn off the two-step authentication (I thought I can login via apps if I turn it off) but the result is the same, I can't login. Maybe because the apps doesnt support in android version 5.1?

	  Mostly great but can't customize themes in mobile. When accessing the external admin portion > appearance > customize > Frontpage sections - it's impossible to open sections for slides and banners

	<comment>
	   I like my text to be aligned as justify and there are no text alignment options I can see. I can't publish posts from my phone without having to go on desktop and justify text first. It's a pain. As is uploading images to a post. But for rough drafts, this thing has changed the way I blog. Please fix missing features or just direct me to them if I've missed them! Thanks! **EDIT** Thank you for responding. Of course! I should have thought of that. It's not as easy as the kitchen sink but it'll do!

	   i had this rated 5 stars, but the app changed and now i can't find the "more" tag. It really reduces my happiness with the app. Maybe i'll have to move to Blogger.

	<comment>
	   I normally use my phone to write blogs and then suddenly after this update, I'm not able to do a single thing properly. It's so disgusting. The pictures won't upload and then suddenly after writing a whole post,the article disappeared. Moreover,after I uploaded my article, I wanted to edit it but then it won't show up in the blog post section. Do something about it. It's getting difficult to write.

	   I use this on my phone all the time to work on my blog. On the whole it's excellent however one thing I find really annoying is how the align function for inserting media spells center wrong for HTML. I know centre is correct but the browser doesn't know that! This is an easy fix for next update, please

	   This app is not very good. It worked on one of my devices for a little while. But it doesn't let you login to external sites very easily. Even though I'm typing in the correct password and username and url I can still not login on the app but I can online. Needs fixed.

	   I used this on my phone as I preferred word press over tumblr but the mobile client isn't as responsive. It would get stuck on uploading pictures frequently despite me working on Wi-Fi instead of data. I have high speed internet and tested other sites to determine whether it was me or the app... It was the app. Great when it does work, just has issues with pictures and gifs.

	   ...but just barely. Every time you people update you screw something else up or you take away something we had before. Please... do us a favor... get out of the business... stop pretending you know what you're doing... find some programmers that care... and you people can go flip burgers for a living. I've had enough. Uninstalling and happy to be rid of you and the app that has become pretty much worthless thanks to you losers.

	<title>Shit for uploading</title>
	<comment>
	   This app is useless for anything other than to check the traffic to the site. I have been trying to upload a photo post for 3 days. It just stalls the upload at 20%. Also what bullshit about custom notifications, the WP app for blackberry curve had that feature back in 2012. Don't make excuses about the OS browser's compatibility and get to work fixing the issues.

	<title>Good app overall, with one annoying bug.</title>
	<comment>
	   In some instances, editing in "webpage" view mode (as opposed to "html") will alter the code -- even if you don't change anything and immediately toggle to "html." Making "html" the default view should be a workaround, but as it is, I have to save my script in a 3rd party app and re-paste it in if I want to make any changes since my script is immediately ruined the instant it opens in "webpage" view -- which somewhat defeats the purpose of having a webpage editor in the first place.

	   Didn't work first with self-hosted sites, but apparently Ubuntu xenial doesn't install php-xml by default while Trusty did (default LAMP install). To bad it doesn't do single sign on when you go to view the admin settings for example (starts webbrowser)

	<title>Internal View Site removed</title>
	<comment>
	   The View Site feature was really the only feature I use in this app. The View Site that opens externally is pointless, I don't need an app that launches another app, I can launch Chrome directly if that's what I need. I know Chrome renders better and everything but that is not an excuse to remove a feature. App uninstalled.

	   The app is really good at what it does but it has some problems with uploading photos some times in the posts, the uploads would just freeze and is missing a search function for categories and a tags picked like on the web version. Other than that is really good to go and useful!!

	<comment>
	   I mentioned the reader I meant I'm not able to view my site in-app. I like using this app even when there's issues but I'd love it if the reader returns. I do like the addition of searching for posts via keywords & hope that stays. An improvement would be if the posts related to the keyword(s) weren't in random order by date. Also, I've noticed when I try to visit self-hosted sites it goes to their blog in-app it'd be nice if they were available to view in reader.

	   I used this app so I could easily access my wp dashboard for hosted sites. It opens externally now, what the f will app do? View stats and make posts? That's not why I downloaded this app.

	   Why do you have to have a wordpress account to login to ethnicelebs? In 2014 I could login with my gmail, but now when I try to login it says "The email could not be sent. Possible reason: your host may have disabled the mail() function." What the heck does that mean. I tried multiple times to login by installing the WordPress app but I'm still not receiving emails to retrieve my forgotten password. It's SOOO complicated. Why can't I login to ethnicelebs with my gmail anymore ?

	<title>Numerous Issues</title>
	<comment>
	   App lacks a lot of basics when trying to write a post (font alignment options and such) which is annoying. Push notifications have stopped working, even though I have them enabled in the settings. The app does not sync with anything done on another device (whether a pc or another mobile device) so I can't draft a post on my phone then do final editing and uploading on the computer or vice versea etc. So many little issues add up to an app that is a hassle to use rather than the convenience it should be.

	<title>My first issue has been fixed, but why did the link for view site moved down to the bottom of the application?</title>
	<comment>
	   I don't understand how it is more useable by putting the View Site link at the bottom of the application. It was nicer having it right underneath the the blog page that is being used. Please change it back. It took me five minutes just to figure out it moved. Plus it doesn't make sense that it would be at the bottom when the site you want to view is right on top.

	   I was looking for an application to create a fairly basic blog. WordPress has enough features so that you can create the perfect site for many purposes yet it is no overwhelming. There is plenty of choice for themes for websites and use does not need further knowledge of computer programming etc. I have found that this application enables me to have a good quality website. Thank you.

	   In the latest update the choice for "View my site" has been removed. I assume that this is an error, but I would rather have it back since it allows users to inspect our blogs in real time, which is a very useful blogging feature.

	   I loved how easily I could upload images for my posts on wordpress. But with the app, I cannot upload an image, even if I tapped on the "Add new" tab. Also, I have to sign in everytime I want to access to my account, in spite of checking the "Keep me signed in" box. I can't find an alternative app for WordPress and I am really disappointed with the app of the website I so love.

	  Thought this was a simple way to easily create a blog but it wouldn't let me have the same username/blog/url name so I attempted to delete but apparently that isn't an option. Followed all the steps to change my email, that won't work either. I've tried several times and the link I'm being sent via email just keeps bringing up a page telling me I need to confirm my email again. I clicked contact us to get help, but it just posts it to a community forum???? I just want the whole blog/username GONE

	<comment>
	   Uploads fail with or without images, without reason. Other reviews seem to indicate it's a crap-shoot; sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. These days, it's just as easy to use the WordPress Web Interface. Easier. Don't waste your time on an app that fails so frequently.

	<comment>
	   It's constantly jumping around, slow, bulky. Not enough editting features. This app literally made throw my phone agianst the wall when I was in the midst of writing a post when it jumped to the web page without me pressing anything. Wordpress you can do better, this is pathetic! Copying and pasting something shouldn't be a task.

	   I used to love how convenient it was to make posts on the go but recently my app has been malfunctioning. It won't save any of the updates I made on my computer and it continuously exits me out the app! Ugh it's so annoying! But having it is really useful when it's working properly.

	   I write longer and more often now with this app. It's excellent and only limited by the quality of your mobile typing. The new Visual Editor doesn't work. Typing places text in random positions on the page and removes other parts of your post uncontrollably. Only the html editor is usable.

	<comment>
	   Videos won't upload, the keyboard glitches. The mobile app sucks, the follow blog widget isn't working. It keeps sending my users to have to log in when they try to like or follow my blog. And I have tried to fix this over and over and over. It shouldn't be so hard to allow people to like the blog!

	<title>Posting many large images is IMPOSSIBLE with recent update.</title>
	<comment>
	   Before I could hit publish and it would do the entire post. Now it seems like I have to do every image individually and with 20 images or so this is tedious, plus they stop uploading and it takes ten tries to finally get them uploaded (I'm doing full size. Also, I like the idea of being able to insert many images at once, but without the ability to sort them by folder, this feature is pretty useless if you have hundreds and hundreds of images on your phone because it's impossible to find the right ones.

	   It used to be just a simple link and the YouTube video or Instagram post showed up. Now you finish a wonderful post and you publish only to realise that the video and post ended up as links on the post page. Awful update. I'd revert to older versions till this is resolved.

	<comment>
	   When writing a post on the desktop and mobile sites, and on the windows app it allows you to control where your posts are being sent. For example to twitter, Facebook etc. But the app doesn't. I don't necessarily want to send all my posts to social media so why isn't this control in place? 2 stars until this is fixed.

	   It is really a surprise that it does not have Logout option. This feels insecure and bloggers will not feel comfortable using it. I am sorry to say that i should uninstall it immediately

	   I have been using WordPress for coming on 4 years now and it's come a long way. There are not many problems for me now that I've figured out the specifics. But there is break in time.

	<comment>
	   Read more button lost, clip tray option not showing when copy pasting items. This causes loss in productivity and posting stuff is very time consuming now. Plz revert to previous update or make changes in the current app.

	   The web version of WordPress doesn't share consistently. Pictures are taken from my file and applied to random articles without warning. The mobile version is ten times worse. Writing on your cell is atrocious. The text isn't consistent, there are no color options, pictures are shrunken, and captions distort everything. This app is a waste of space.

	   I like a lot the app because I can can write drafts wherever I am and I like the last changes. But there are some little things to improve still: the text alignement is not in the tools bar and the feature image can't be chosen directly from the device.

	   I've been using this app for some time for short private posts as a starting point for posts I'll finish up on a laptop. I've always had good results and for normal use I cannot fault it. I have however recently added U2F support via a Yubico recommended plugin for use with my Yubikey NEO. I now find I cannot login via this app.

	   I have been trying to upload images for quite some time and the media simply will not upload. I Uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Made sure my themes and plug-ins on my self hosted WordPress blog were all updated . Checked the dimensions of the image. There is a progress bar when the image is being uploaded and no matter how many times I try or how long I wait...the image doesn't get uploaded and there is always an error.

	<comment>
	   Can you please fix or explain why the new post editor strips all the captions I have written for images? Update 2/7: contacted support team, no response. Your editor is stripping HTML that was previously fine and does not even display captions anymore. Posting images is also extremely clunky and I am not sure how to get multiple images to appear side by side anymore. The new version is a regression. Guess I will look for a new blog platform

	<title>App loses posts-no restore option</title>
	<comment>
	   Warning! Don't use this app to write your posts. Safer to write them elsewhere and then copy paste and upload, which essentially you could do using just the website so it renders the app pretty useless. I have lost hours of work on a blog post, all my text from the post disappeared (not sure what I pressed) then I pressed the back button on my tablet and the app saved my new (blank) post. No option to restore a previous version as all my work was done offline as local draft. Not safe to work on this alone!

	  Since the update some of my words are typed twice when I press the space bar on my keyboard. It seems to happen at random but only happens in the WordPress app and only since the update. This is very irritating as I cannot get through a sentence without having to edit my typing. Also, it'd be great if posts didn't automatically try to refresh and only show the most recent few when I open the app as it makes it a pain to go back to older posts as I have to re-download them taking too much time and using too much data.

	<title>New to blogs,</title>
	<comment>
	   I've had my blog for almost 3 years and the procedure for publishing be posts: is a simple as using a word processor. For the first time blogger this is a great choice. It allows you to move on to a full sites once you reached levels that advertisers want toput ads on your site on your blog. But there are limitations wifi free version including not being able to post videos, so getting news followers is more difficult. Persevere and you might even get paid. Upgrade is $99 , I think pretty steep.

	   Early versions had severe bugs making it semi-unusable. Now it can get the job done, but there are still plenty of little rough spots.

	<comment>
	   Com'on guys. Just because the Internet died for a few moments at some point, I lost my entire post. Wouldn't you want to save a copy on my device (or on my website in drafts) once in a while just in case? Uninstalling and using browser from now on. Epic fail.

	<comment>
	   Wordpress is my free app to post my personal blog. For seven years I have been blogging on Wordpress with no complaints. The only drawback is that occasionally the folks over at Wordpress change something that is not broken in the software; consequently; the fix creates a glitch in the app that takes a while for WordPress to correct.

	<title>Annoying!</title>
	<comment>
	   Generally okay if a bit confusing. But if I publish posts through the app the stats say no one has read it (when I know for certain people have). This leaves me with no accurate way of knowing how many people have read the post. Also if I save a draft and publish a few days later it says I published when I saved the original draft. I use Wordpress for professional purposes so both of these things are extremely annoying and not worth the hassle. Stick to the internet website.

	<comment>
	   I'm not sure what the bug is, or if it is a "feature" but I have been working on a document for some time that I was nowhere near ready to publish... Thinking that "draft" and saving means that, you know, it is going to save your post as a draft, shouldn't raise any questions. Unfortunately, as pretty as the app is, every time I close my tablet or disconnect from wifi for a moment, every supposedly "saved" draft immediately deletes itself forever leaving only the post title behind. Why. Why???

	   I love wordpress on the desktop. On my pc I can access my site easily. But the app refuses to allow me to sign in. It tells me my login information is wrong, yet I can sign in just fine on my other PCs. Not sure what the issue is with the app, but I am forced to use my mobile browsers to use Wordpress on my phone, which is a shame. I will change my rating if I can find a solution to the problem.

	   I erased and image and it literally cleared all i have written and there is no undo button. Sometime when i click on bold and italics and write something when i unclick both of them the italics leave the written word and leaves just only the bold p.s you need to add a copy link of post button and an undo button. I also realise it cant upload most images that are a bit large then it says error..sometimes the bold button keeps activating itself after deactivating

	   It won't sign me in. Likely because I renamed /wp-admin because I didn't want it to be so obvious that I was using WordPress as a CMS. However, the app should account for that and allow me to specify my admin panel pathing. 0/10.

	<comment>
	   I used to give the app 5 stars, but they changed something with an update and I lost selfhosted access through this app. If WordPress would simply start making YouTube video tutorials for setting up these type of apps and server prerequisites, support would be much simpler. Dozens of people having the same problem, asking for help in the WordPress forums, and being treated like trash. WordPress support system (along with this app) sucks!

	<title>Log in issue</title>
	<comment>
	   I have issue with log in/log out. Every time I open the app it says that I have entered wrong username and password. And asks me to log in again. And sometimes it is showing error and doesn't let me to log in for 20 mins. It is so annoying. I can't track my website in time! 3 stars until it's fixed.

	   I'm having problems with the latest update of this app. Once I open it by clicking on a notification, I cannot do anything else as it freezes. It's a shame, as the previous version has worked relatively well most of the times.

	<comment>
	   I was working with a beta version which started to lag and hang. When I removed the beta this problem was tackled. But since a couple of weeks the app has started lagging, hanging and crashing again. I am very unhappy about this as I am now unable to use an app that worked very well.

	   Lately it's not keeping me signed in. I check the box for "stay signed in" but it constantly has me log back in. Also when editing my menus from the app while on my phone, as soon as I try to drag a page to reorder the menu it automatically scrolls all the way down making it impossible. Please fix these issues and thanks.

	<comment>
	   I wrote an article and was saving it for later and then got a new phone and logged in and the article was deleted. Only stored locally? Come on wordpress. I logged into my account, I should have all my drafts. Do they do much for the community of users also because I have only had 3 followers in 3 years. They should feature well-working websites. Also, I cannot figure out how to do a sub category link from the main links. It goes dead. I will keep researching but some of it can be frustrating.

	  I hope you Wordpress guys read this because this is getting horrible. Writing an article is ok although a bit limited, but once you press the Pubish button havoc begins. First my Samsung Galaxy Note completely locks up, then apparently it cannot handle the stress anymore and just reboots. And this happens EVERY time i post something more than a one-liner with an image. More then one image difficult, video impossible. I upload only via Wifi. Please debug this thing or crate something that works.

	  This gives zero explanation of what this app actually does. I loaded it and attempted to sign in to my self hosted site just to see what was possible and it won't let me log in. I keeps saying to check that the url is right. This is a useless app.

	<comment>
	   I generally like WordPress, however, the app has some problems. If I save a local draft with pictures and exit out of the app even for just a few seconds, the formatting goes wonky and half the pictures disappear. Now just recently, I wrote up a really long post, hit publish, and when I checked on it, it had saved as a local draft. I hit edit and the ENTIRE post disappeared. I restarted the app and my phone and it's still gone. I'm not sure I'll continue to use this app after that!! :(

	   They claim free, and yes parts are. But I own my own domain URL and that's not free. It's actually almost $9 a month. Why can't anyone say "free" and mean it? Or when they say "free" list what isn't at the same time.

	  On the whole this is an easy app to use and creates a nice clean blog using the default Chateau template. However it doesn't seem to want to let me add pictures from my android phone gallery. If there is a way to do it, it must be rather convoluted and byzantine, because nothing I have tried seems to work. I can do it from my laptop, but not from my Galaxy S6 Edge plus. (Edit) - Just found a way to add photos - but still cannot do it while I'm writing the post. I have to add to the media library before I start the post.

	   Can't add new Pages... Only posts. And editing pages is in html mode. Also I think the feature to Delete your entire site is just dumb, dumb, dumb.

	   This new update sucks!! I can't upload images from my phone to my posts. It only shows pictures I've already uploaded from previous posts! That's no good! This renders the app useless to me. Will uninstall if this isn't fixed in the next update.

	   I have two WordPress accounts for two separate blogs. I wish I can use them both in one app without having to sign in and out again. If that can be made possible, I'll rate this 5 stars. Also I wish I can edit a lot more settings while posting in the app: sharing settings, featured image, etc.

	<comment>
	   As a way of putting together posts on a phone, this is a great app to have. It doesn't handle intermittent internet connections well at all though. The handling for syncing, especially images needs work. I've lost work a few times due to this. At the moment it's best to put in placeholder text for images while working on a post, and then later putting in all images when you have a stable net connection.

	<comment>
	   Every post I write is accompanied with extra hours of redos, redrafts, and rewriting as the site seems to pick and choose what to keep when you hit save draft. The application never ever works without several bugs to work around. Uninstalling, logging out, force stopping, nothing works. Can't wait to switch to Squarespace.

	   Comments don't load anymore.. Not sure if WordPress update broke it, or app update broke it.. Have 5 WordPress self hosted sites, no comments load. Please fix this. Comments still broken, can't add multiple self hosted anymore, after adding 1 all others say error. Almost everything is breaking for self hosted WordPress sites with this app. Hope it gets fixed, used to be great app.

	   It takes several tries to publish. The majority of attempts result in a soft boot. It also loses the draft that is supposedly saved. Rewrites of the same post over and over is lame. This is all on a Nexus 6p with the latest marshmallow.

	<comment>
	   I recently had an issue but they helped me fix the it. I do have one request for the developers. It would be nice if I could edit my posts in more of a WYSIWYG way like on the website. Right now I have to edit the HTML to make changes which can be useful, but many times more of a hassle. It's also not user friendly for anyone who doesn't know HTML5. If you could add a visual mode to the app it would be useful. The in-app support chat is excellent though.

	   I'm new to using WordPress. I have a blog. The app lets me do everything that I need to. The most helpful thing is that I can add HTML codes in the post editing area and they actually effect. I haven't encountered the problems that others mention here, but I hope that they are fixed before I do.

	   Im uninstalling this purely because it doesnt sync with my computer. I have drafts on the app that I know have been published on the computer. I have drafts on the app that do not appear on the computer version. Its a waste of my time and disappointing.

	   When you start writing a post and choose the align text tool, through Web, bug problems (codes on text) appear, if you want to resume / keep writing your post through the app. Maybe it is best, until improvements, to keep using just the Web, unfortunately

	   I don't know why so many people have put this down. It works fantastically for me. Great app and allows me to do everything I need to. It's just a tad slow

	   Awesome!!!! However since you're just working on a mobile device don't expect the full package since uploading pictures can be quite cumbersome. However it's good enough for text posts with simple formatting. Love the layout and the thumbprint recognition on top of the passcode!!!!!!

	<title>Notifications Blocking My View</title>
	<comment>
	   Everytime I visit my blog through this app the notification panel just occupies the three-fourths of the screen and there is no way to remove it because everytime I tap it what is clicked is the blog underneath.

	   Serious you lads can do better. You Web interface by far the best. Your windows app for desktop is tight. So why is the Android version different. Typing is so chaotic, why not bring that same interface on Web to android

	<title>Flawed update. Downgraded for now.</title>
	<comment>
	   Very slow to load tabs, and switch between my site, reader and settings. Sometimes it just fails to respond and stays where it is. (All this on a good internet connection that loads everything well in another web browser app). It ultimately just refused to let me go back to 'view site'. Please fix. Reverted to v4.0, which doesn't look as nice but does the work.

	   I don't really do blog on mobile, but I enjoy using WordPress for PC when I need to post something. I only use the mobile version to read others' blog and respond to comment. I think it's still inconvenient for me in some ways, esp the interface for editing and publishing post. Idk, may be it's just me. Oh, anw, would you pls add an option on the setting so I can open a link through mobile browser? Esp for non-WordPress site. And if any WordPress link I found somewhere can automatically be opened in the app

	<comment>
	   It works most of the time, but it likes to mysteriously delete parts of a post or a whole post when publishing. I spend an hour while traveling only to have my posts constantly deleted when I'm trying to write or edit them. STAY AWAY FROM WORDPRESS IF YOU NEED TO USE YOUR PHONE FOR A BLOG...THE SITE DOESN'T WORK WELL FOR UPLOADING PHOTOS AND THE APP CONSTANTLY TRIES AND EVENTUALLY SUCCEEDS AT DELETING YOUR POSTS AND PHOTOS...STAY AWAY...FIND A DIFFERENT BLOG VENUE!!!!

	  I love wordpress! I do wish there was a way that you can receive access to more plugins on your tablet or mobile device. Possibly a monthly payment plan instead of yearly for certain payment options with features.

	<title>Signature Setting removed?! Has WP gone insane?</title>
	<comment>
	   I'm stuck with the glitchy reader version others are noting in their reviews. I've been using WP daily 4 years now... I know my way around the app very well. Some updates have been awesome, some not so much. I can't update if your going to take the signature setting away! Why do that? I have html in mine and would have to look it up & retype it each time I post. Seriously! It's not a whole page, just keep it where it was, in the account page. Let me know when WP has come to its senses. ..

	   Hello creators of WordPress! I must say, what an amazing job you've done, after all, I began to love your app since I downloaded it haha! May I suggest something? I'd like to see if there's a feature you can come up with that enables users to create certain groups to post their own blogs for sharing experiences with classmates, teammates and colleagues, and A SCRAPBOOK THEME OR LAYOUT for an awesome edit! Thanks again! Keep up the good work!

	   I installed and had a login issue straight off but you have integrated support right there to help streamline efforts. Turns out your people discovered an issue I'd been having problems with for other things which also prevented my login. Because they helped troubleshoot things I was able to "kill two birds with one rock." The app works great and I'm pretty much your evangelist.

	   I don't know what you've done for this app on the latest update, I try to change the language preferences setting to Indonesian, and all the issues that happened on previous version aren't come up on this version. The app is working very well in Indonesian mode. It's awesome. Thank You, WordPress. Thank You, Automattic. :)

	<title>Where are my followers?</title>
	<comment>
	   All my followers have disappeared. I have to re-follow from their likes. Also, if I read someone's post, then like it, it disappears. Something has gone wrong. Please fix. No I don't hate WordPress, it's an awesome app, but this is annoying.

	   I'm unable to update my self hosted WordPress website from mobile because Select Media button is not working, same problem was in previous release, after update I thought that it might be resolved but no improvement. When I install app for first time everything was good and working so I suggest same to my client's, but no solution after updates 3 times yet.

	  Thanks for the response. I think it was 'user achievements' notifications that I needed to turn off I believe. Rather hard to find for a notification so likely to annoy users, but I guess that is just my opinion and I appreciate your pointing me to the solution!

	  How people rate this app so highly is beyond me. This is simply one of the most awful apps out there. The interface is muddled and feels like an alpha. Going to admin is just a browser window that doesn't work as well as your browser. It has quite possibly the worst editor I've ever seen. You're better off just logging in with a browser than wasting your time on this. This is a half baked broken app. It's a good thing they don't force Android users to use the app like Evernote does, because this is atrocious. Just log in with your browser and use the web interface because its infinitely better than this.

	  This is a very good app. But after the recent update (some days back) I can't see the STATS widget. That was really helpful. But now I have to go to the app and check my stats there. I am giving 4 stars just because you guys removed the widget, else this is a 5 star app.

	   As a college student, I created a blog and account for a class assignment. But I have started using it more and will keep using it from now on. This site is the best and very helpful on getting your blog account set up and creating posts plus changing design layouts etc. Making and writing blog posts has improved my writing and gives the viewers something new to read about. #ThePerfectApp

	<comment>
	   I love Wordpress, but the mobile app truly sucks. It's so difficult to use, and very limitedbon what you can do. Can't figure out how to change password, how to search for bloggers or how to physically post something after I've written it. Would rather use desktop version of Wordpress, and just use the app to check stats.

	<comment>
	   This app has used 750MB of mobile data in 10 days and I haven't even used it very much - and I usually use it on WiFi anyway! It's a very nice app but there is something wrong with the data usage.

	<comment>
	   This ap let's you keep tabs on your blog stats, traffic,and comments pretty decently. You can change your post status which I have found helpful at times. Only real problem I've had is trying to edit previously published blogs - doesn't seem to like anything but plain text and I lose content and readability when trying to make even minor corrections to posts with pictures, bolding, etc.

	<comment>
	   I'd consider myself a fairly light user, just want to do text and pics with captions on my phone as I have no PC access. Adding the pics is a nightmare: I've lately been using the multiple picker, but it doesn't recognise albums, and its very clumsy to scroll through thousands of pics. Have a workaround for that, but then changing btw apps or just scrolling up and down in editing mode results in a crash sooner or later. At my wits ends. I refuse to add pics one by one in the media library...

	   I couldn't get it to upload media at first but I narrowed down the problem. It's not file size but dimension. Everything below 2,000 pixels uploads fine, I haven't tested anything larger. Just posting this in case you had the same problem, use an image resizer app.

	<title>Text Editor is rubbish!</title>
	<comment>
	   I have had enough of my photos being moved around when I go out og the Blog editor and then back into it. It moves photos in the middle of sentences. Just went back into it after my phone battery ran out and the last three hours of editing a blog post was lost! I've contact WordPress about this bug before and was told to update, which I've done twice since and nothing has changed. I'm moving to a different blog provider. Pathetic!

	  Unable to log in with a self-hosted site on the last 2 updates. I've had to go back to 4.8.1 in order for the app to work for me. 1 star for that, 4 stars for how well it works with 4.8.1 PS: I have tried going through support. Could never get it to work. This applies to a Samsung Galaxy S5, an HTC phone, and 2 different tablets. Anything past 4.8.1 doesn't work

	  Tried updating my post by adding pics to it using the app, and it failed, twice. When I click on updating, it shows me - Upload 1/3 pics, and then when it reaches the 3rd pic, my mobile restarts. First time I thought it might be issue with mobile, then it happened again. The mobile is fully charged and hence i wasn't expecting this to happen.

	   Awesome app, very user friendly, but I would like to be able to add featured images to posts. That's the one thing I miss from the web version, since my blog features an image in every post so I have to go back and edit any I write using this app.

	  Not much use - very disappointing. You log into your 'self-hosted' site and none of the in-app functionality seems to work. 'Couldn't refresh at this time' keeps being shown. Instead you need to view the website and then use the normal dashboard, but on a small screen. I could do that in any browser. Please fix the refresh issue.

	<title>How do I contact Wordpress about login problems in this app?</title>
	<comment>
	   I hate logging in to Wordpress. It says I have the wrong password. I reset it. Try to login and wrong password. I have reset password 4 脳 today. wish there was customer service. I used the new password to login to wordpress on my labtop and the "wrong password user name combo" worked there. But it says I have no website yet. I liked this app because it would remember passwords. but everycouple months the app stops working and will not upload posts correct. Now I uninstalled app and reintalled app.

	   I really like this app because it allows me to edit posts when off line, putting changes through when logged into a network. However, it seems to not keep in sync with work done on my desk top. Logged into my desk top or portable device will get me different results, even though both should be synced, that shouldn't matter, right-of both devices go on line and are edited on the same account? I'm pretty sure that I've been saving my changes. Anyhow, thank you for this application. I like the themes.

	   Really made monitoring my stats easier, plus reading posts and getting around my account and blogs. But I have one request, could you add a 'search button' to the 'blog posts'? Sometimes I feel like I'm dying when I have to scroll long just to find a single post. Thank you.

	<title>Hard work</title>
	<comment>
	   This app is ok. The end results can be great if you are patient, but the whole interface is just painful, and I end up putting off updating my blog because I know it is going to be a hassle. There seem to be so many different areas to the app, all of which allow you to edit a post for example, but each with a slightly different interface and different features and options. Yesterday I was previewing a post, found a mistake so clicked edit and went into a completely different editor, which allowed media insertion direct from hard drive rather than having to upload to library first. And now I can't find it. Could be great but is too messy and bitty. Typical piece of software written by a large company with lots of developers who don't talk to each other, and no one person with an overview of what it is really like to use.

	   I got this app so that I could write blog drafts when my computer wasn't handy. It's terrible at this: I can only see half the writing area as the un- collapsible menu blocks it. When I try and write every sixth letter is actually typed into the box and the app tries to close the window before I'm done and without saving.

	<title>I loved the app, but now it deleted my article</title>
	<comment>
	   I use the app frequently to write while I am traveling. I just spent an hour to compose an article. I needed to check a link on chrome and went back to the main menu. It said local draft saved. I looked up what I needed and went back into the app. In the preview the pictures have been scrambled with the text, an issue I had observed already, which I did not really care about that much. When I tried to edit it, there was no more content, everything gone except for the heading. Everything was deleted.

	<comment>
	   I downloaded this hoping it would be a good outlet for posting things I write. Unfortunately this app forces you to keep every line you write extremely short, like 3 or 4 words before it bumps you to the next line. I have more room on this review than I did on their app. Totally screws up rythem, grammer, pacing, feel, and sound. Bad app for writers.

	   As far as tailoring posts is concerned, there is actually far less that you can do on the app than on the website. But if you simply need a quick way to receive notifications, comment and just make quick drafts, you might find this quite useful.

	   I love that this app does not take a whole lot space or ask all the credentials we have. Also, it's sleek and easier to use.

	<title>Good enough. But need more features.</title>
	<comment>
	   I've just used a little just now. And I found that on website, you guys have "open in new tab" feature when we add a link on text, so that users clicked on it, the link opens in a new tab. But in app, there is no such a feature. I had to copy the html code from the previous link I've created using web version (on PC). That's not such a big deal. But I think you guys should add that feature in app too.

	   Good app however I couldn't get the oldest post when I search a relevant tag. It would be nice if there's a filter as well and if there's an index tab for us to easily search what we are looking for, just like in the desktop website. Hope it can apply as well n the app. Thanks. :)

	<title>Could be great, but too many annoyances.</title>
	<comment>
	   Here are the problems with this app on my Nexus 7: I can't upload photos through the app. I have to use the browser version and upload one at a time. Very annoying if I want to put 20-30 photos in a post. If the orientation of my tablet changes, the app resets to the dashboard and you lose what you were working on. The cursor sometimes behaves very strangely when typing, so you end up with one word insianotherde, like that. All of these things make creating a post a slow and frustrating process.

	<comment>
	   1. It doesn't display scheduled blog posts 2. Once the scheduled blog post is already published, it doesn't reflect on the app immediately, in fact it takes ages. 3. Too limited in terms of feature access. 4. Takes toooo long to reflect changes.

	   I found it difficult when I tried to update my primary menu. Super slow respond. Waste my time. Web UI may be the main cause.

	   Private or password locked function does not work when you tap on 'view blog posts'. In the event of 2 administrators, we are able to see a preview of the posts even when we password locked the post. Also, it will be great if you could add in the feature that allows email notifications when administrators add a new post. Currently it is limited to only comments of individual posts. Thanks!!

	<comment>
	   Wordpress never should of been converted to Android. It's terrible, clunky, The visuals are appalling, No choice in what you ACTUALLY WANT, Limited options in theme as pretty much of them are all the same, every 20 freezes and crashes, Makes your device extremely laggy, Avg Reported it as Malware and is possibly one of the worst apps I've ever used.

	<comment>
	   Mobile app does not have any options to add keywords,meta tags, meta description. it uses the default meta tags from the website. which I don't want to, I want a different meta tag for each articles, we should get this access from mobile app, also (Using Yoast plug-in) it is usless to use Mobile publishing because it will be without SEP, simple no Yoast no SEP on article, thus making my articles on Google page 3-4 which is of no use, so keeping it shot please introduce SEO options in this app.

	   This app works most of the time. Slow loading sometimes and ive had problems adding photos to my website on the mobile app, though that source is most convenient. Easy to navigate, and simple to make website changes.

	   Beats the purpose if website is where you have to go to access tags and home. The app only shows blogposts in the order of them being updated. Need to be able to see tags and home page of a blog in the app instead of just blogposts

	  The display is awful. When I try viewing my site by the function "View Site", it displays only a quarter of the screen, which is very narrow and hard to follow the whole post. The remained screen contains my blog name's, the "sign out" button and that's it. Please kindly fix it by either try make the display as fully as when browsing on the computer or widen the screen of post in "View site" function.

	   The app is awesome, the ability to personalise your blog is subpar anything you can find on any other app. But there seems to be a major problem.I can't login even after trying a dozen times and when I do login, I can't access my posts or anything at all. Apart from that I can't edit my posts because the process never completes. I'm not sure why this happens but I noticed that it works slightly better when using WiFi instead of mobile data. I tried using other apps and they all work fine.

	   I'm quite satisfied of the blog as a customer, but as an admin the site is awful. When I want to copy some of my text or even write a new page or article, the first screen thumbtouch engaging keypad, it goes to top page? When I want to change for example title menu it refresh for each single letter??? And there are few problems which i'm also not entirely satisfied. Can you fix it please? This app doesn't fit on android phone, moreover since nothing has been fixed, I changed to 1 star

	<comment>
	   Online and in mobile I'm asked for a verification code, but I never receive it. It refers to an authenticator mobile application, which I can't find. What's even more amusing is that the online help requires me to login with this code before makingr a help request... So I'm unable to use my account, or get help. Interestingly enough, the rest password sends me a mail to my email address.

	   Everything looked great until I tried view my site on the mobile and for some reason my old notifications keep popping up and take up almost the entire screen and there is not option to close it. What the heck is going on?!

	<title>Why did I give this app a 5* is beyond me.</title>
	<comment>
	   You guys really need to make this app more like the desktop version. I can't do anything with it. Even after today's update I'm still switching between the app and Chrome app to do things. I really hope that your new OSX app for Mac isn't like this or I'll end up using Safari to do my tasks on. This is why developers make apps so people can do the things they would've done on desktop. But you just can't.

	<comment>
	   Last bug doesn't save changes, 2 stars. 1 star for new bug , thank you Automattic, now you give me duplicate post and when I delete 1 post then refresh, guess what? Both posts disappeared, no where to be found. Trash folder is all empty but when I delete a post on web, it move to Trash folder. Here's a tip: Don't write app if you can't even know how to! Now I lost my post forever thank to a bunch of lazy developer at Automattic. Is this app automatic delete my post too? Won't test this for you.

	   The app is very efficient and concenient. The switches from one panel to another are smooth, and the loading of images and texts only takes seconds provided that the internet connection is excellent. I also like the feature that I can make a draft in Wordpress even if I am not connected to the Internet. I suggest the app to have the other editing tools available in browser and desktop version of Wordpress such as text alignment, text font or size, etc.

	<comment>
	   When disconnected 1 time during the upload... It not able to keep uploading when connected back again... It s bugging the app and freezes and the device restarts itself (it s in the draft uploading for ever... Even restarting the device is not helping... Removing the app and reinstall helps though) ... Big definition video doesn't resize automatically depending on the theme of the website. Updating an existing post is not wysiwyg, modifying a video after posted is impossible... This app is full of bugs.

	   It used to work flawlessly, now it only uploads and syncs 98% of the time. 2% of the time it works. Viewing stats is possible, so it's not completely useless - just 98% useless. XML-RPC is enabled, the problem is the app.

	   As a professional writer and Author, my blog is vital to my career as it allows me to keep in touch with my growing community of fans. At times I do not have access to a laptop and would appreciate an app that actually works and allows me to check and manage my blog, to which I pay for the domain server. I fail to see how this app has median average of about 4-stars considering it fails to function properly. From Author J. Adam Snyder

	   The iOS & mobile browser versions have more functionality than the Android app. (Can't set featured image for example). I would rather maintain my site via the browser or iPhone than through this app.

	   Uninstalling this because it requires the use of XML-RPC on your site. XML-RPC has been shown recently to be vulnerable to hackers which is why I've disabled it on my sites. Unfortunately, it looks like I'll never be able to use this app because the developers are uninterested in addressing the issue.

	   I don't know if this happens to anyone else, but for me it continuously makes me sign in. I can understand signing in again after an hour or so of inactivity. Even 30 minutes. However, I have to relogin after 5-10 minutes of inactivity! Maybe even less than five minutes! For instance, I'll type a draft and save it. I'll go to another app and come back to Wordpress within 5 minutes and it makes me sign in again. It's very irritating. Also, I can't seem to post media on this app.

	   1) it's missing a search field. 2) no multi select and upload of multiple images from a single folder, it's either messy all together or one by one. 3) I lost the whole text and images of a new post because of an internet connection error, this should not happen no matter how bad the connection is, offline editing is what users expect from an application vs the web-admin! 4) post settings button is hidden when keyboard is open 5) can't edit site url 6) can't batch upload local charges

	  Great app but one problem: can't share in a Facebook page. You can only share on your own wall, on a friend's wall and in a group. Used to be able to share in a page but for some reasons we can't do that now. Please fix as soon as possible

	   The app is nice and all for quick posting but it would be better if you add some more functionality. Like creating links to pages from our blog (internal hyperlinks) are a pain. Make some shortcuts for that and so on. But the app works great. Thank you.

	<title>Okay for emergency but needs work on stats</title>
	<comment>
	   While this is a handy app for on-the-go posting or editing, the stats are not very useful. For example, although it's nice to show that I had 905 hits from the UK or US, the fact that I cannot see which state or city within the countries listed, or even more importantly, the breakdown of the actual pages/titles for those area makes the stats useless. I recommend bookmarking your Google analytics page instead...

	  It's OK. But on viewing my draft to see if it looks OK to post I get a big pop up I can't get rid of saying it has no notifications yet(of course it doesn't. IT'S A DRAFT). Please get rid of this or give it an x button so I can get rid of this annoying notification as I can't see if the layout of the post works!

	   The app is good, I'll recommend you guys insert the post formatting functions in the new post window. It's highly irritating to not be able to adjust the text in the centre alignment etc. Since the app is for posting on the go, it should at least have all the functionalities to enable the user to do so. Please update.

Plus, I get to keep up with blogs that I follow while on the go. *update* I've tried to open notifications all day and they won't open. Some aren't even showing up. I knew that I shouldn't have installed that update. Please fix!

	<title>App not broadcasting from phone</title>
	<comment>
	   I use this app to blog while working full time and I can no longer broadcast posts using the app on my phone. Constantly coming up with a server error but I've had it checked! Very annoyed. Why work for months then suddenly stop? What am I missing. Also regularly only saves changes as local changes rather than uploading to the server!

	  Was able to connect to my personally hosted blog. Everything looks pretty good, but the Featured Image setting doesn't work. I add an image from my Media Library, then edit its properties...Check the box for "Featured Image" and then leave the box for "Show in post" unchecked, but it always just shows the image in the post and refuses to set it as the Featured image, no matter how many times I go back and try to edit it/redo it. Unfortunately, that was the main function I was hoping to use, so pretty worthless to me.

	   This is an awkward, buggy, un-user friendly mess-- but the blogs I follow are WordPress-- so I plow on. Reader NEVER works right, won't let me read comments, add comments, or "like" a blog entry-- so I wind up using my browser anyway. The blog themes and settings are cumbersome as well, and just as buggy.

	  So wordpress decided to log me oit a few days back and that's it. No matter how many times I try it won't log me back in. I know my username and password is right because I logged in on the web just yesterday. Another thing, it won't let me schedule or post a draft. Very annoying. WP kindly fix this.

	  The app has got very good options to add an image with your write up or multiple images or to change the theme or background while it also gives an option to share your write ups on various sites which helps increase the readership and the likes and comments on the blog. The only thing that should not be there is the ads that pop up when someone opens the link of our write up which is kind of distractive.

	   For me this is an important feature as i like to record where it is i've been traveling. Still buried and can't default to on slightly buried the new set up doesn't work with postcodes and wont let me view a map to confirm correct location. Why not use a small map and overlay crosshairs to allow confirmation or manual alteration?

	   Sends a publish event which posts to Twitter even though it's an update to a post and not a new one. Web interface works fine, and so did the last version of the app.

	   This app helps do quick posting of pictures and blog entries on website and much more. Also extremely great customer service. I was doing something wrong, emailed Customer Service with a question and they got back to me within 10 minutes with a 100% perfect solution. Full stars in my opinion.

	<title>Suggestion</title>
	<comment>
	   Great app, but please modify the app to make it smoother for your phone and actually LIKE an app. What I mean is that the app is identical to the mobile version of WordPress on Chrome (or any other mobile browser). I downloaded the app for convenience and a smoother UI, but it's the exact same as the website. Please modify the app so it's more like an actual APP. Otherwise that, 4 stars.

	   Avoid this app if you're an on the go photographer that posts images from your DSLR. I can't even get this app to upload an image period. From built in memory or the SD card. Utterly pointless and useless for any photographer that runs a photo journal on the go. Phone: LG G4. Android Version: 5.1.

	   Almost didn't bother downloading based on a lot of negative reviews on here, but I'm glad I did. I could never use the browser on my phone to post because the formatting got all out of whack - but it works great through the app! Also if I paste a poem it actually keeps the indents where I want them, which I haven't even gotten to work when posting via desktop computer.

	<title>Terrible, confusing app</title>
	<comment>
	   This app is absolutely horrific. It is so confusing. The website itself is pretty awful but the app is terrible. It is not user friendly at all. I am 20 years old and use new technology every single day for my major and job. My college recently made students create a WordPress blog and post as homework. I have not met one single student who even remotely enjoys the website. There is a reason nobody I know used WordPress until it became mandatory. I hate every minute of using this website and app.

	   This used to be a really nice app until I got the latest update. It's slow, loads very few posts on the reader and when it hangs while I'm using it, other people can't access my site! I simply hate and I advice you not to update your app if your still using the old version. . . Oh, and another thing, you can't view all your followers and the stats area is just complicated and useless. They have also removed the widgets area

	   Updates I made are out of sync. View Site button is not showing all kinds of updates that I made and I know my changes were submitted. There are multiple pathways to make changes, but that is no use, because I don't know which is the one that will work. It keeps loading comments in a pop-up in front of my page and I can't close it!

	   I can't count how many times I've spent hours writing a post only to have it vanish just because I rotate to screen from vertical to horizontal. WHY DOES THE APP REFRESH JUST BECAUSE THE ORIENTATION OF MY PHONE CHANGES???? So sad that such a powerhouse such as WordPress puts their reputation on such a terrible app. Fix the orientation issue please.

	   This app is useful for mobile device users. If photo resize option is available to reduce photo size while uploading a post, it would be great. Please add this feature "Reduce image size" while adding a media especially through camera.

	<title>Deletes posts, will not bring up self hosted blog when I sign in now</title>
	<comment>
	   WordPress has been sort of a nightmare for us for a number of reasons. We have spent hours and hours writing posts only to have them deleted when we try to add photos. Some versions over the last months have uploaded all photos in a blog post over and over when half have already been uploaded. This had been a nightmare when visiting places with poor internet. Now we made the mistake of logging out and when we login, self hosted blog will not come up. We are trying to put up the final post for a 4200km hike!

	<title>Please roll back to Older Version</title>
	<comment>
	   Why was WordPress came as app? Previous version was quite simple, easy and worked for mobile with even 2G. You know the facts about mobile internet speeds. The newer version has many cons. Please remove image preview under each post listing as it takes much time for me to navigate to Older post even when I am on WiFi, it doesn't even load on mobile with 2G or 3G. Graphically its good but ground reality is that I have stop accessing my sites from WordPress mobile app. I Rolled back to Older Version via APK.

	<comment>
	   I can't get it to work. I get SSL errors with my self hosted WordPress 4.1 with a free SSL cert from StartCom. Clicking Yes on the error does no good, it just pops up another SSL error, then another, on forever, never actually making any progress. Clicking No obviously doesn't fix it, and Details just pops up a blank screen with a title at the top.

	<title>Need Alignment Option</title>
	<comment>
	   Note 4: When working within the wordpress app, the visual editor options are limited. I need control over aligning my text. If I want to center a title and then left align the cursor to begin my writing, there is no option available. If I go through the web, all the text options appear. I need access to alignments and justifications in the visual editor tool box on the application, not just through the web. I've read up on something called kitchen sink but I cannot apply it to the app on my note 4.

	  Assalamualaikum... Buat para pembaca.... Jika seorang wanita nikah dengan seorang pria idamannya yang umurnya sudah memenuhi syarat untk menikah, ia menikah d luar daerah, namun nikah tanpa wali ayah,karena ayahnya telah meninggal, sedang ia masih mempunyai saudara laki-laki kandung dan kerabat yang menjadi walinya. Sebelum ia menikah, terlebih dahulu ia telah memberikahukan kedapa saudaranya laki-laki dan kerabatnya bahwa ia akan menikah, dan ia ingin diwalikan oleh saudaranya, sedang saudaranya atau kerabat dekat, menginginkan ia pulang kampung untuk d nikahkan dengan pria pilihannya, namun karena rasa takut d pisahkan dengan pria pilihannya dan keadaan ekonomi yang membatasi, ia nikah dengan di walikan oleh wali pengganti (orang yang bekerja di KUA). ApakahApakah pernikahannya itu sah? Atau ia harus dinikahkan kembali dengan diwalikan oleh saudara laki-laki atau kerabatnya?... Mohon penjelasan dari para pembaca..

	   I've use WordPress for a few years and do love the service. I give 4 out of 5 because I hope these could be improved:1.the Sign Out option needs to be much easier to find, or a pattern lock will do too, 2.May be we can choose the old tags from a list instead of typing anything?

	   It's now 4 stars because I loose my drafts whenever I log out. Recently changed my deviced and I lost my stuff - not fair. Fix that and it's 5 stars all the way. I love the interface now. Feels fluid.

	  It was really great, but recently I was working on a post. It took about a week to write, I was going to post it today, and it was gone. Totally wiped out. I now have to write the whole thing over. I'm so mad! It wouldn't sync when I logged in on my PC. This needs to be fixed!

	   It's alright if you're looking to do very basic things. But if you'd like to use it as you would the main site, good luck. Laggy, unresponsive, and a tendency to freeze unexpectedly. You're better off waiting til you have computer access.

	   Is it just with me or is anyone else facing a similar issue with their follow button? I can't seem to follow any one from the reader itself. I have to go view their site in the chrome explorer and follow them from there. I'm worried others might have the same problem following me! Please help and get an update faster!

	<comment>
	   When I turn my phone or tablet sideways, I loose all of my previous work. I try to "save as draft" but have no means of recalling said draft. So, after an hour of work and editing, if my phone slips, it is all gone. Please look into this and I will be happy to fix my review.

	   If you draft a post with media, save it and then go back to work on it later you will find that there are duplicates in your media file. While working in limited and expensive internet countries this is a real bug bear. I won't be using this app until they fix it.

	   This used to be a good app but now it struggles to be stable. After viewing stats or notifications the app freezes and Android prompts me to kill it. This has happened on my tablet and now my phone. I'll give this a higher rating when the issue is resolved.

	   This app used to be a lot better! Get constant server errors when trying to simply view the site or access admin, among other issues. I host multiple WP sites and I know they are all functional. However, you can manage and add posts, etc. So, there's that.

	   The app never used to crash and now it crashes at least once or twice everyday. Also, the notifications used to appear instantly and now while the push up notification notifies me that there are comments on my blog, the notifications feed doesn't show those comments. I have to now go to my App Settings and Force Stop the app and open it again each time it crashes or the notifications don't show up. Sorry to have to delete it but I can't work with a faulty app. Please fix it.

	<comment>
	   This is the worst app ever. Every time I access it, literally every single time, it crashes. After the recent update, it has become unusable. It only notifies me of maybe 10% of the comments and crashes every time I try to access them. It also crashes whenever I try to post anything. I have never seen an app so bad in my life.

	  I think the biggest problem with WordPress is the lack of optimization services. It seems as if the creator of this app was pleased with him self for putting an exact replica of the website on a mobile screen. But apps are supposed to be an optimal, functional and simplistic experience that promotes on the go usage.

	<comment>
	   Having to search for blogs via tags or url is ridiculous. This app needs a feature where you can follow blogs via similar interests, not merely by what is suggested by WP. I love using this site but it's not the best way to follow blogs. Pick up your socks WP. You're not new to this.

	   If Android has a better blogging app (1) What is it? (2) Why is it better? Only thing is I would occasionally like to have video in my posts, but I also understand that not everything can be free all the time. Simply the best.

	<title>Feeling out of sync</title>
	<comment>
	   I would love for the mobile app and the website to be more in sync. (Que the boy band) When I have done work from the app and then go to work on it on the site, it doesn't even show up. And going in the reverse is very difficult.

	   Cannot load photos from the app. If I do get lucky and get a photo on, when I hit upload it just sits there 'uploading' and I have to restart my tablet. Sometimes I can't even type on a post. Looking into other blogging services.

	   Could be good but its useless due to the problem with establishing connection. I have to reload 10 times for my post list update. Its the same with pages, stats, publishing a post, even with login. I tested this on many wifis, with data on, on different devices, ... Same problem everywhere. Fix it and ill give you 4 stars. UPDATE: if i could id rate this app -5. Its pure crap. I was writing a long post, but this app only (due to its problems with connection) only saved the first paragraph. Uninstalled.

	   I absolutely love this app! The only thing that frustrates me, is that a blog post I started writing on my old phone via this app that is saved as a draft, isn't available to view or edit on my new phone via this app or even online on my computer via the website. Otherwise, I love the app.

	   I can never edit my post on the first try. There will ALWAYS be an error and wants me to refresh. Even when I have refreshed, I still can't edit my post. Until when the app feels like it then can i edit my post. And the app feels just like a blown up version of the phone one.

	<comment>
	   Does not work if you have a custom admin panel URL (anything other than /wp-admin/) and there is no setting that takes care of this. Thus, the app is useless for those of us who care about their blog's basic security.

	<comment>
	   One of the major attractions this app has for me is the ability to write offline posts. However, two bugs make it completely unusable for that purpose. First of all, adding images offline and then reopening the post with an active internet connection removes all the images. Second, if the internet connection fails during a post upload (eg one with 30 images), the whole upload hangs, the app has to be force closed and then the upload restarted from scratch... This has litteraly cost me hours of my time.

	   Can't see anything on the page where you type your blog on the app, with the keypad obscuring everything even when I'm not typing. Today (which was also only the second time), when I posted on my blog, WP wouldn't let me reposition images inside the article after adding descriptions to them, both on the app and the website and I had to add an additional note at the beginning of my article explaining the images, compromising its structure. I'm new to WP and intend to write more, so please fix these asap.

	   This app is terrible for Android. I haven't installed it since I switched from my iPhone...but seriously, step up your game. I can't even change my profile pic, preview my post or anything. I'm surprised I got something to post!

	<comment>
	   This was working fine until I updated it a day or two ago. Now the picture resizing is not working, image captions don't appear, and in the editor the cursor appears several spaces in front of where it actually acts. It's completely unusable like this, please help me to revert to the previous version!

	<comment>
	   I've been travelling and thought this would be an ideal tool to blog off line as I travelled. Don't try it. I lost hours of work as any attempt to add to or edit your very first drafts results in large chunks of text being lost. Developers eventually admitted it was a bug but aren't bothered enough to fix it before the next major version.

	  This is a great app, but the latest update 4.3 messed up. Notifications, werent updating, reblog and like buttons were gone, and the contact function didnt work so couldnt even report the issues. Left a message here which seems to have disappeared, butsince then have read about the 4.3.1 update, and IT SOLVES ALL THE ISSUES! Immediately! So give it a try. I wish Automattic would have sent out the update automatically (pardon the pun!) to save us all this grief.

	<comment>
	   I'm a little put off that this app is only a fraction of the experience you get on a mobile browser. It's not even a similar experience to the already-unnecessarily-complicated one you get in WordPress, rendering it unintuitive. You can't even do basic things like set the feature image. It's almost insulting that there's a way to access the admin dashboard through the app, which literally just opens the mobile WordPress in an in-app browser. From there you can still access all WordPress features. So why...

	<comment>
	   Since a new update the option to reblog a post from another blog I follow is not available. Or am I missing something. I use a Note 4 . How do I reblog it's driving me mad . Since I last updated the app I can no longer add pics or compose and send a post without getting an upload error message. It really ia not good enough. I run a successful blog but am finding it harder and harder to do . Please fix this issue. Others have mentioned it so please reply.

	<comment>
	   Doesn't seem to support any standard styles (h1, h2, blockquote, etc). Therefore, cannot write a post start to finish - always have to go back and edit from a browser before publishing even a simple article. Fail.

	<comment>
	   If there is one I can't find it. While using the app on samsung galaxy note 3, a botched copy and paste attempt resulted in an entire post disappearing. Very infuriating!! Will never write a draft in this app again. Will write it elsewhere then transfer in. Plus it won't upload my video. Says I need to update video press. Even after I updated the wordpress app. Why isn't everything included in one app.? Update: July 22 2015 just installed an update and now I can't see recent comments on the app feed.

	   Update to rating, After getting help from customer support, they were able to get me into my account was very fast with the response even after several attempts to get in, until they worked out the problem. Now it's not an issue. . . . Tried many times to log in, and I know the email and pass are correct, however it says they aren't correct! So disappointing.

	<comment>
	   I love this app and it allows me to do a lot with all the sites that I manage. There's is one major feature missing from the app and that's the ability to sync/backup the site list. Every time I have to reset my phone or I get a new device I have to manually add back all my self hosted websites.

	<comment>
	   Shows only 2 out of my posts! Where are all others? Then, trying to open a post, another error. Won't open the site at all with stupid security message. Totally unusable now. Not even 5%. Not even viewing postes. Why put a non working app on google play? Why misleading the users?

	   Worst app I have ever tried to use. It will not even let me upload, all I get is an error message that I was not authorized to do that. I was able to upload to the site without the app so why not with the app. Would love to know.

	  I mostly use this to keep track of my stats and likes. I can't imagine writing all of my posts on such a small screen, but I've browsed through the interface and used it a couple of time for very short posts. It's very fluid and responsive and appears to provide almost all of the function of the online site! Good for people that always want to keep an eye on their blog.

	<comment>
	   I wish that I could give this negative 100 stars. I hate the set up I hate you have to go through so much to get your drafts or posts synced to the desktop and I literally hate this app because my local draft just erased and now I can't get it back.

	<comment>
	   The first thing I noticed was how slow this app is on my Note 3 phone. Hardly any of my other apps are anywhere near this slow. Okay, so maybe the server is just sluggish. I like this interface. It lets me type, but that's about it. It has an image upload feature, but the file browser never even launched. Uninstalled.

	<title>Terrible bug that deletes posts</title>
	<comment>
	   I rely on this app to communicate. Wordpress itself is great, but the app will delete an entire post, losing me hours of time and energy, if I back out or answer a call while the post is loading. It appears to do no cached versions, so everything is lost. It doesn't even do a "you just said to save a blank post instead of the 1000 word 12 photo one you had, is that on purpose?" I do save every once in a while, but it doesnt matter with this issue, it saves over. Back up your stuff on another app.

	<comment>
	   Spent an hour writing a blog. I attached 1 small video and 7 pictures. Clicked upload and 5sec later phone was sluggish and unresponsive. An hour later on ultra high-speed Korean 4g LTE+, the phone was still unresponsive and the app still said uploading. Had to restart phone. Went back to app, clicked local copy then edit. Blog was there for 3sec then went blank. Had to rewrite. Same issue again when I tried to post. 5hrs and 3 rewrites later, blog was still not uploaded. Worst app I've ever delt with.

	   It's very good. Unfortunately, my anti-virus would always say there's a virus in the app. I keep on uninstalling and installing it. It's very useful, so I had to install it and wait for the security to send a warning again.

	<comment>
	   Uploading photos is slow and painful and makes my phone and tablet unresponsive. I want to love this but I'll stick with the website version.

	   The creators' commitment to open-source allows for some truly personal and innovative blogs and folios. For my purposes, it's probably the only thing succeeding old MySpace at the moment for an online haven.

	  Was very frustrating for first time use. If it turns out to be a learning curve, I'll up the score. But it kept losing my text and freezing up when I tried adding an image. Took five tries to get it posted. Not happy right now.

	<comment>
	   I wrote an entire post that took several hours on this application and when I published it, it deleted the entire thing and published a completely blank post. I'm horribly annoyed and can't believe I ever wasted my time with such an awful blogging service.

	  While everything else seems fine and functional with the newest version I've noticed that it shows my blog as having about 2099 posts while I have over 2200. The comment counter is also far off and the categories. It would be great to see this aligned properly for reference. UPDATE: It's been over a year and some revisions that I pointed this out and its still not a rectified issue. Now the blog has over 3100 posts and yet the app shows 3060. Otherwise I really like this app as its quite helpful.

	  Was brilliant now a bit crap.... I have 2 self-hosted sites.... I can add both to the app and make posts however the main use I have for the app is stats which I can see one sites stats but not the other and I end up in an endless loop of logging in to my wordpress account to connect to jetpack.... Needs an update.

	<comment>
	   This is a great way to draft future blog posts and look up visitor stats, as well as checking comments and other notifications. In this new version, WYSIWYG editing is back again - I missed that! By the way, the mobile web site is at least as good as this app so be sure to check that out too.

	<comment>
	   Used to support self hosted WP sites. Now only works with WP sites hosted by Wordpress. Developer wont give feedback or support. Youre better off using mobile webpage to work remotely. This app is an abomination!

	   The new update. Now I can't upload my photos. . It took me 8 hours to get 4 of five photos to upload. I had to change it to gallery etc. It's a mess. I just did a factory reset on my phone. It happened before and after I rest..... I can't find the link on the website for tech support so lame. The app was perfect before. I'm visually impaired. I could see it better. Light Blue and white is a graphic design nightmare. And it's harder for me to see the new app type (accessibility).

	   Nice layout. Easy to use. Add pics to post via camera or gallery. Only thing missing is add new post option on main screen. In order to add new is selecting posts from left sidebar menu. Click on orange circle with plus. ##update 11jun15. Like the new look. Much better easier to navigate.

	  Can only view list of posts for single blog, can't get to comments or change blog. Am on Samsung Note 2, and rely on this app when away from home. Please fix. Comment below has resolved my issue (I removed app shortcut and replaced, and now opens at control panel.)

	   Quite possibly one of the worst apps out there. Simply doesn't work. Connected my account but absolutely nothing else about it works. Doesn't refresh, can't post new stuff, can't edit existing stuff. No response from support. Expected better from Automattic. Uninstalled.

	<comment>
	   Data review is broken, permanent 503 server error when viewing site too, log in doesn't work unless app is force closed and restarted then your magically logged in, or your logged in but in the app your logged out and nothing updates which means a complete reinstall is necessary as no other workaround has fixed that issue. Uninstalling, if I could give negative stars I would.

	   I use the mobile app on the road to update my travel blog, and post picture galleries. But I can not upload cover pics anymore for them. I don't know whether it's a phone issue or an app issue. Please look into it. Would rate 5 otherwise. Thx.

	<comment>
	   Tried this app off and on since it first appeared on the market... Using the web interface is still more intuitive & MUCH more reliable. Content uploaded with app has *many* unexpected "quirks" with formatting & media presentation. Really not clear what purpose this app is attempting to serve, aside from an academic prototype for showing some of what the api allows.

	   The app will not work on my site. I have a self-signed SSL certificate (nobody else logs onto my server and needs to verify its identity). If I try to log in, a warning pops up. When I tap Yes to log in anyway, I am returned to the log in screen.

	   This is great for them blogging moments whilst travelling or to schedule posts on the go. However it does sometimes remove photos upon save and lately has been deleting content of full blog posts, giving me an error when I upload. Had to reinstall.

	   I love this app now. I didn't really use it on my iPhone because I couldn't really do much more than post or edit. But on my Samsung Galaxy S6 it does almost everything I can do on my computer in this app. Which is exactly what I needed. So I gladly give it 5 stars.

	<title>SOLVED: Problem when inserting pictures</title>
	<comment>
	   The problem described below has been fixed (at least on my device). Thanks guys! - Several days ago, the app started freezing the entire device every time you tap the "Add image" button. Only solution is restarting the tablet (power button, press & hold). The tablet is a Lenovo B8080-H running stock Android 4.3. Also tried rebuilding the media library, but to no effect. Other than that, I'd give the app four stars.

	<comment>
	   Trying to add an image to a post is impossible. I click in the icon to uploade an image from either the device or site, and the uploader just keeps rotating every few seconds, it's ridiculous. Can't get it to do anything. I just sit here watching it rotate 45 degrees over and over and over again till I close the app.

	   In general I was very happy with the app. Never caused problems and was fun to use. Recently (probably after upgrade) uploading photos became an issue, but for me the worst is that after two hours of writing a post offline I got online and instead of uploading, the app just deleted everything!!!

	   Makes it very easy to manage multiple blogs. But, very limited configurations. Anything advanced in your posts or blog architecture is non-existant...simply must be done on your pc. This is a great app for basic posting and monitoring the stats for your blogs...but that's it.

	   Very limited editing options e.g. seems to only operate in text view when editing pages. Cannot record a page as a child of a parent. Much better to use WP in the full mode from a browser.

	<comment>
	   I really liked this app until I updated it. Now when I go to edit my blog page, the side by side settings overlap each other, making it unreadable. I also found this app was freezing up my phone too. So much for easy & efficient on the go. I think I'll start looking for another blog app, for when I get to frustrated with this one.

	<title>Absolutely Awful.</title>
	<comment>
	   As other reviewers have said, the app freezes up whenever I try to insert an image. I have a Samsung Note 10.1 and every attempt has locked my tablet. I attempted an uninstall/reinstall and the same problem occurs. The window also begins cutting off longer posts. The post is still there, but you will need to use your up/down buttons instead of the scroll function to see it. There is also no menu once you get to the post screen. Navigation between dashboard, post, and post options is difficult. I have been frustrated by the last several updates to this app. If you need to only post text, it isn't so bad, hence two stars. Any posts beyond simple, short text should be done online.

	<title>Very basic</title>
	<comment>
	   Seems to only be useful if you have something that you have to post right then and there. If not, skip this app. You can't even do basic things like change text color (unless you type in html). That seems to delete the purpose.

	   I use Wordpress as the site for my business and have always been happy with it, but the latest update is absolute garbage. It now won't let me upload images from my tablet directly to my posts, and if I try it crashes my device and I have to force close my other programmes and have to restart it. This has a big effect on my online work. Dreadful.

	   I would just LOVE to use this app, but like other have said, adding pics is just not a possibility. My tablet freezes completely everytime I try. Also, I can only save drafts locally OR publish them. I would like to save them online without publishing them, so I can add pics over the internet, after writing with the app... but that is also a no go: making this app completely useless to me. If I want to write when I am not online, I can use a word-processer.

	   I really love using WordPress for my blog, but it's frustrating using the app to try and upload any images into a blog post. My tablet freezes completely when trying to add an image,resulting in me having to restart it every time and not getting anywhere so I end up doing it on my desktop. The thought was to be able to post while I'm away from my computer but it's failing.

	   I'm using a Samsung note 3. It won't allow me to select any images to upload. And thought the app it's messed up with text appearing over the top of other text and really just doesn't work well. Especially hard if you have two blog pages. Very difficult to switch between them.

I always have to fix an article in my laptop or iPad.

	   but shear horror if you want to upload images.Upload is interrupted most of the time leaves the local media cache completely broken.No easy upload of multiple images (workaround via filemanager share dialog), no progress bar on upload (no idea if finished, incomplete or still working).Crashes if accidentally refresh media library during upload. Please devs, add a decent way to upload images with progress info and feedback if it was successful or failed. Otherwise it's a real pain in the ass to use the app.

	   Update: the small issue I was having was resolved promptly. I am a big fan of this very good app. My original review was: "The latest update is not helpful; my password doesn't save on my phone (HTC one m8), so every time I go to the app, I have to log in again. Not a big deal for you, maybe, but having the brain injury I do makes this issue inconvenient enough to consider moving my blog to a different service altogether. Please fix this!"

	   Since the last update I can't use my regular photo viewer to choose pictures from my post. I now have a list of images that seem to come from my tablet but not it's sd card; where all my images are. I have around 30,000 images in various picture folders (I am travelling and have a 128GB sd card in my tablet where my images are stored) and this update to 3.9 has made choosing images impossible. I have two possible workarounds. Either I upload the images to google or similar and put a link in the post to them. Or my second option is to upload the images in the WordPress app through the media menu item and then choose these images I want in the post using your new chooser interface. Honestly I see what you are trying to do with the new interface but it does limit the user as to how they choose their images. Handing this task over to the operating system, as it was before, makes more sense and makes your app lighter. Please switch back to the normal way of adding images. Updating posts on tablets and phones has been great with the WordPress app and I feel it's just been made more difficult with this update.

	   I am new with this app. I just created a post yesterday, and now every time it starts uploading, its like my phone doesn't want this app running... So its saying "uploading" then my screen goes black for a whole minute. And backs out of the post. So I have to upload again, but no, does the same thing. Tried it 5 times. What's up with that? ~Droid Turbo device~

	   Wordpress should stop fixing things that aren't broken. They went from the absolute finest blog platform to a sputtering, smoking wreck at the rear of the pack. Simply attempting to insert an image into a post now completely locks up my tablet. Stop fixing things. Now I have to find a new blog platform. Bring back 3.8.

	   Every time I try to add a photo to my post it hangs my tablet, making the screen completely unresponsive and randomly changes the screen orientation even though tablet hasn't moved. Only option is to reboot, losing all work. Please fix! UPDATE: I uninstalled this version (3.9) and installed the one from the Amazon Appstore (3.8) I can now add images and find photos again. Not updating until I know everything is fixed!

	<comment>
	   I just used this to perform a relatively simple task - edit a post and upload some images. The post editor showed all the markup for links, formatting etc, which looks messy and is hard to navigate. Worse still, I wanted to upload more than one image, which I wasn't given the option of. I had to upload each one separately and re-find the folder they were stored in each time, which is time consuming and tedious. The mobile website is flawed, but much better than this so I'll go back to that.

	   I have multiple wordpress blogs and when it works it's great but it consistently losses login info to one of my blogs so I'm constantly having to add it back and I've gotten no response about that from their support team. I've now recently lost the ability to use the app after signing into an account since it keeps throwing me in a loop to sign back in. I doubt I'll have this issue long if it's happening to more people but it seems they have consistent login issues they need to fix otherwise it's great!

	<title>Add images severely broken</title>
	<comment>
	   It tries to load every single photo on the phone, but barely displays thumbnails for any of them, making the app useless. Need a way to select between photos and downloaded reference photos, otherwise it'll take forever even if the thumbnails worked. Very disappointed with this update, I'll be using the web browser to post until this broken app is fixed.

	   This is pretty great too. One little tweak though. When you press the upload button. Can you put something like "are you sure you want to upload post?" Because i press that button accidentally.

	   I always write from the desktop but having an hour to kill, decided to draft my next post using this app. Writing could be a serious and involving matter... Once done and seeing the full text on the screen, I backed out to the post listing, clicked on my draft and to my despair, only saw first few paragraphs saved. A rare free hour wasted. Now rewriting on the desktop

	   Great app. I use it just about every day to comment on WordPress blogs I follow. I blog from it sometimes when I'm lazy. I do want to inform that this past week, I've been having trouble viewing my site from the app. ADDING 04.13: I've had to use the live chat help a few times. They're great and patient with your concerns/technical issues. I was able to resolve my issues in record time.

	   **Update: uninstalled because it keeps locking me out despite putting in the right credentials.Pics upload just fine, blogs post just fine, kinda strange to navigate, somethings are just kinda buried in a menu of a menu. As a whole its not too intuitive for a brand new user who has never done this before, and it is somewhat limited. All in all its pretty well done and does the job. Why 4 stars? The dashboard is hidden in a menu instead of on the main menu on the left. Too important to hide!

	<comment>
	   Taking away the ability of CSS from the free users was a super bad move that will soon make the site fall, as users will now move on to newer sites with better options. A better idea would of been making the use of CSS limited, that way you give a taste of customization to your patrons, and they'll be more likely to purchase. 馃槍馃槖

	<comment>
	   Year after year, the same crap....I just spent 45 minutes working on a post. I pushed the button to publish, and Wordpress immediately said it could not publish. (Not sure why, b/c my internet connection is fine.) It didn't save the post, the whole thing is gone, up in smoke. This app might be good for a Buddhist who wants to work on not being attached to his/her posts, but as far as a blogging app goes, if it doesn't save your posts and loses your hard work, then it's crap. Don't bother.

	   Wordpress is honestly one of my favorite apps by far. You can publish good quality posts and keep track of everything very clearly and easily. it's a must to all the bloggers out there!

	  I can't tell how good or bad this app is as it won't let me log in to my self hosted website. It doesn't recognise my details but they work when I log in on a web browser. I'm hoping it is better than the last version, which had random error messages when I tried to refresh any page (particularly the comments section).

	   I use this app to blog while traveling. I have had simple posts (just text and photos) upload as blank SO many times, which I finally realized is when I have too many photos (now I try to cap at 10 or 15). No indication that something is wrong, just waiting 30+ minutes for an upload, then finding out that it is blank. No usable draft, no way to get the content back other than to start over. So incredibly frustrating. Also, formatting is off when I try to edit on a desktop when I've saved a draft from app.

	   It is handy for a lot of things, but if I edit a post between my 3 different devices, I never know when the changes will stick or if I need to copy and paste to and from a different cloud document app to ensure I'm working with the most recent revision. Kind of defeats the purpose of this app

	   If I create a post the first time, I can add a gallery, insert pictures, set the featured image. But if I open an existing post I only see shortcodes, cannot change/remove featured images and cannot edit images/galleries, only the shortcode directly.

	   For years I have loved WordPress. The PC version of WordPress I always always loved. You can do anything with it. But on PC years ago it got tiresome because unless you got a team or the right tools its hard to code or it takes money. I love the WordPress APP because now.. the mobile version is even more simple and yet I about gurantee the code and skins will be so easy anybody can do it. Which in this day in time, Tools like WordPress are always important! But there is nobody.. like WordPress!

	   I'm running version 3.8.1, and I really like the interface. Improved utility, too. The previous problem of retrieving stats on only one blog seems to be fixed. Occasionally I have to re-enter login information on the 2 other blogs - this seems to be a problem at the WP servers, not with the app itself. Good app, and getting better.

	   I feel really, really grumpy after watching the actual functionality of this app, iOS and Android, go to zero over the past several updates. As of tonight I can't even post a short update. This feels like a real betrayal after having migrated from another CMS when this app was one of my most desired features. Hoping it gets fixed.

	   Great app. I can put in posts, save them as drafts, and edit them later. I do this during down times at work or when I'm away from my laptop. Great convenience. I'd love an offline mode though (unless I just haven't found it yet)

	<title>Doesn't support custom taxonomies</title>
	<comment>
	   Basic functionality is great, but this app doesn't support custom taxonomies. My self-hosted website has custom taxonomies. But when posting from this app, I only get to choose the standard categories and tags. The custom taxonomies aren't listed. It would be great if someone could guide me to an app that'll fulfill this requirement.

	  Love having access to my site from my phone, being able to put pics directly into wordpress from my phone is great and a time saver. Can be buggy. Never let's me approve comments or reply to comments from the app. But for what it does, it does much of it fairly well.

	   Always fails when I try to upload any post with pictures! Always after uploading all but the last then it fails saying unable to resolve host!? Please sort/help! Has also cleared a fully written draft post that I can't get back, as has no trash or resorted drafts options. On the website, it doesn't shoe the drafts from app either. Help!!

	   This app seems a bit pointless. It doesn't give you access to sites you've connected to your WordPress account using Jetpack, and it doesn't seem to support adding sites protected with Rublon, which WordPress recommends. Fix these issues up and it would be great.

	   Since the update, I have had numerous issues. Unable to publish, loosing my vital write ups and so on. My posts have been removed and overall my website and its work, the majority of it has vanished all down to one simple tap of the publish button of what was to be a new post. Which did not publish other than wipe my hard work. So thanks for that guys! Much appreciated! I will never rely on this application again!

	   There will be days where it runs so smoothly, and I have no issues with it. Then there are days when I have great connection and the app craps itself and errors come up. I've even been signed in to my account, and the app is asking me to re-sign in, and telling me my password or username is wrong, when I know for a fact its right.

	   It keeps telling me to use lowercase. I do. Still won't let me blog. It will not let me correct anything, just keep inputting what I deleted.

	<comment>
	   I have used WP before and found it very engaging. Least to be said, I'm now approaching it at a very granular level, so, there's some exploration to be done. Whatever I've seen so far I've liked. I hope WP agrees with me and remains the same.
