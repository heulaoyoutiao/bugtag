	  It's an absolutely amazing app and very necessary to have, especially for series junkies like myself. It used to be so hard to keep up with my favourite series, but Series Guide has done the magic. Thanks to the developers

	  Pretty cool. Only use it for tract.tv (which I HIGHLY RECOMMEND). Once integrated it helps me keep track of my next episodes and new shows I don't want to forget. I am a heavy user of Kodi, and with tract on the and in the app, it is very helpful. There are some anomalies with sync, but I haven't used it enough to elaborate further. Once I get to the bottom of it (could be user error), I will gladly bump to 5 star

	  When marking an episode as watched through trakt, seriesguide takes an excessive amount of time to sync to the new update. Air times are off by several days and forcing manual update takes longer than expected to update.

	  Finally... Tried so many apps, and wasted money on a couple. But this one just does these simple things everyone needs. Plus more, if you want of course, and if not it's not being showed down your throat.Will definitely get the VIP or whatever the premium is called just as soon as I get some pay come in (yeah, literally that broke). Don't care much for vip functionality but just want to support.

	  Developer please port to Nvidia Shiled Android Tv with controller mouse pointer support. I currently have it sideloaded, and created a banner for leanback launcher. Please Uwe Trottmann port to Nvidia Shield Android Tv/ Android Tv Native!!! This app surpasses TvShowtime in various ways. Also I like you added comments. PORT PORT.

	   It integrates with Trakt as well which is really nice. The only thing I'd like added is a screen that shows the latest episode of your shows that you haven't watched yet so you can see what you need to watch at a glance.

	<comment>
	   Love the design, although I did have a bit of trouble figuring out how to make it show my trakt shows. I won't be using the app though, since you can't set a movie or episode as watched, if you've already watched it once before (unless you choose the check in feature and have it "record" as you go). Otherwise, it looks like a really good app!

	   Love this app! Every film or show that I could possibly want to watch is at my fingertips. And if you're into tracking, the auto tracking of what you've seen is a nice addition.

	   Absolutely love the app, but would be super helpful if there was a second location for series that you've finished. So that they can move from your current list.

	  One of the best apps out there. If you are like me and have a wide variety of shows that you watch this app will help you keep track of every show you watch. You make a list of shows you watch then it tells you what shows are airing next and also has list of shows that aired recently. Once you check the box that you watched that episode then it disappears from your list. This is also great if you are trying to keep track of shows you are trying to catch up on. This is exactly what I needed.

	   I had a lot of shows too. Plus progress in most of them marked. Now I don't even want to go through the hassle of adding them one by one again and marking episodes as watched. The supposed weekly backup file didn't even work when I tried to use it. The menu said no compatible backup file exists (or something like that). It really annoyed me.

	   I've only tried three of these apps that syncs with trakt but yours is by far the best one. Keep up the awesome work. Though I don't think there is much more to be done? Oo

	   Constantly misses shows I've already watched on Trakt, doesn't sync my watch list, has its own separate watch list? It's a fine app by itself but the poor sync capabilities won't work for me.

	   There is only one issue i found, tought. It doesn't show the Saint Seiya - Lost Canvas in my list, even if i try to add it again, it will say "Saint Seiya will appear on your shows list shortly" and never does. Also, the Saint Seiya - Hades OVAs are nowhere to be found. I hope it gets fixed/added soon. Aside of that, it's a very good app.

	   The desktop version in my opinion is a mess, but because this app is so fluid, I don't need it. However I would love a calendar weekly view instead of list, would be better alternative to the "upcoming shows". Keep up the good work guys.

	<comment>
	   I like SeriesGuide and I recognise it has gotten better lately, but I still miss the automatic show sync-ing across my two devices. It sucks that when I start "following" a slow on my tablet, it doesn't get tracked by my phone. I've of course linked both to my Trackt account! Still, takes sometimes forever to set an episode to "watched", then fails, fails to add shows to the watchlist...

	   This app used to only be available on my tablet and I've been hoping for years that it would make its way to phones! I watch about 15 shows each season plus I binge watch new ones and this app allows me to keep track of them all. Seriously my favorite app ever.

	   Posters have been removed from the movies history section, please put them back it looks plain and ugly now. (Update:) I cleared the cache that's not it, It's been this way on my phone and tablet ever since the newest update version 33. (Update:) And there's no other way to display the images?

	   I loved this app. However, it has been annoying me for some time now. Every time I check in, it automatically sends a tweet via Trakt. Now I know that I specifically chose to connect my Twitter with Trakt.tv. I don't want to change that but I hate these automatically generated tweets when I check in with Series Guide. I don't know how I can turn it off. The options I have now? I can either not check in with Series Guide or I can disconnect my Twitter profile on Trakt.tv. I do hope there's a third option...

	   Nowadays it can be difficult to keep track of all your shows esp when many are on-demand. I've been using this app for a year and it's allowed me to keep track of which episodes I've seen and when new seasons or episodes are released.

	   I'm the type of person who just wants to DVR a TV show and watch it when I get around to it. So having this app is amazingly useful I just wish the multiple device synchronization worked a little better but it's still great

	   Best app hands down. If I could give half star I would have just because with the latest ver 7.0.1 the app no longer closes properly when I press the back button or leave it. I still see it in my notification panel and have to force stop. Please fix!! Also it would be nice if possible to see duration of shows and movies displayed when your in your list, to me seeing date, name, favorite, and channel is great but it's missing duration. No idea if it's possible but just something I think would be nice to have

	   It's amazing that you guys added the "No Spoilers" option. God knows how many plotlines have been ruined for me because of "accidentally" reading the episodes' description. Although I must say that you guys ruined it by hiding even the episode name. No point in using this feature if it hides THAT. I don't think there was a need for it. The interface looks bad without the episode names. Maybe, re-think it!?

	   I'm really loving the app but there are a few niggling things for me. I can't see a way to categorise TV shows into currently watching and watching. The UI to interact with TV show cards and other areas can be quite difficult. Still it's very good and I'm already using it a lot.

	   I initially synced it with Trakt and liked rating episodes, etc. I switched to syncing with SeriesGuide Cloud which is, for me, more reliable and consistent for backup and syncing but lost the ability to rate episodes with Trakt. Not a big deal, though. The upcoming show notifications are quite handy. The layout of the app is nicely designed and intuitive to use. Using the paid version.

	<comment>
	   I watch a lot of shows and always forget where I'm at. Like with Game of Thrones I had to wait a year for the next batch of episodes to come out. So I started watching other things and forget where I was. As I missed a few seasons and am now playing catch-up. With this app I keep an eye on all my shows and no which episodes I'm up to what and when the next episode is coming out.

	   This thing helps me keep track. It works pretty well and syncs if I want it to to Trakt.tv so I never have to re-do my watched shows and figure out which ones I missed. It also let's me backup the old fashioned way. UI button for the check marks could be better, now and then I tap the check mark, but it thinks I tapped the show and takes me to the details.

	   I've been looking for an app that can help me track the shows I watch offline. This app had everything I was looking for! I love the fact that I can even organize the show into lists, and that the shows had brief details about them like the casts. It's really a great app. :)

	   Excellent app. Very informative, very intuitive, everything is at hand, or at your fingertips. Seriously, amazing app. I don't rate it 5 stars just because I haven't found an option to move a series or a movie from watchlist to the collection automatically.

	   I'm a huge binge watcher and I watch multiple shows at a time so this is perfect for me. I can see how many episodes are left, the descriptions, and it's easy to mark the watched ones! Great for keeping track of movies as well! Almost makes me want to watch more shows and movies for the opportunity to use this app!

	   I use it everyday to know what episodes I've seen and not seen since my DVR regularly misses things. I only have one problem with a series missing from my list. I think it might have to do with 2 shows of the same name being added and removing one. Can't fix it.

	   Paid for the full version as I am that impressed. The app is very refined. Found every show I've searched for. They can be added to favourites so they appear at the top (very handy for the current shows you're watching). There's synopsis and a screenshot for each episode. Looks great (material design). One of my favourite apps. Got Trakt setup on Kodi with SALTS. Fantastic. All next episodes are waiting...

	   I LOVE this app. It helps me to keep my shows up to date and it also reminds me the films that are going to be released. It would be great having an option to update the info for movies on watchlist, as the update option for series.

	  This is the perfect way to keep track of what you have or haven't watched. I still haven't figured out how to fix the time for us not in the USA.

	   Why's the widget all ugly now and not transparent? At least add an option to change it so I'm leaving one star til its changed back also I preferred when it showed episodes in the widget the exact minutes before it aired for example like airs "in 25 minutes" and counting down instead of the exact time it airs I just remember an update sometime ago took that away and found no way to change it in settings.

	   Works pretty well, but light on features. Probably the thing I use most is the Trakt.tv watch list to keep track of stuff that I'm going or want to watch. Good for keeping track of what I have watched.

	   Very useful! This app let's me catalog my shows and easily keep track of what I've watched, what I need to add to my collection, and what is to come. I no longer have to pull out hard drives and scroll through files to know which shows I'm missing or wonder which episode I last watched.

	   Una app perfecta para los frikis de las series, te permite tener un registro perfecto de por donde vas en cada serie, las pel铆culas vista, series que quieres verte, y una cosa que me es muy graciosa es que va contando las horas que llevas viendo series, para mi es perfecta. (Y encima ocupa muy poco).

This app is super helpful to track when you watch and episode so you know how far you've watched. It's also gratifying to check something off your list (if you like that kind of thing). Good app especially when there are so many shows to keep track of now

	  Awesome! The best app I have used to track my shows. Best of all, it always has a backup, and syncs with trakt! Only nitpick is that, when I set an episode as watched, I also what the option to tell when I watched it, like in trakt. But overall, AWESOME! :D

	   I'm using the app for 1-2 years. It's a great way for tracking the schedule of the favorite shows. I'm using the widget but I was missing the feature for the shows that have passed. The pro version of the app shows the shows that have past but the update of the widget is very rare.

	  Great app! You can even sort shows into lists if you want. It's up to date but it could have more info on actors, in case someone wanted to see what other shows they're in. But I guess there's IMDB for that...

	   This app is essential for me to keep track of all the shows I watch. I work so much it's hard to remember when a new episode airs, this app totally delivers. The only way it could be better is if they figured out some way to automatically track episodes you watched. This app is still fantastic anyway and I love that it syncs between devices. Keep up the great work!

	   Exrtremly good app, until 2 months ago, when was the last update. Now, just 1/4 of the shows appear at the uppcoming section, like the others just disapear. If I didn'd understood if I need the payed app just to see all the show's I'm very sorry, if not deserve lower than one star. Solve this problem and I'll change it to 5 star's as it deserves.

	   Great app! The best way to track your series. But it's tiresome to re-set it after a factory reset of your phone. It has a backup tool but never worked for me!

	   ....for keeping track of all my episodes. It even has most kdrama, jdrama, etc. Would love a feature for keeping track of movies watched. Right now I just add them to a collection but I'd love to be able to add to a watched list or something.

	  i have bought the full version of the app... but it doesn't seems to work... every time i want to restore my shows ... it just shows error... poor website... i hoped they should do something cloud base to manage the lists and shows well... not using until the app is cloud based either using Facebook or google account.

	   I needed a app wich helps me keeping track of the movies and tv-series i've watched. A friend recommended this app to me and i havent stoped using it for some years now. It does everything i need. I can connect it directy to trakt.tv (what i recommend to track movies and get some intresting statistics) and check m the episodes i watched. If you dont want to use trakt at all, you can still use this app perfectly to keep track but i dont know about the movies (because they are not imported in the local db)

	  Tried a bunch of these apps for tracking your TV addictions, and this is the one I kept. It's lightweight, has a simple UI (except for the show detail pages, which are cluttered and have background image bleed-through), and lots of options. The one option it doesn't have it to just show your titles in a list. The app shows everything in two columns instead of just one that scrolls) whether you like it or not 鈥? and I don't.

	   I've been using series guide for 4 years and it's probably my favorite app. I am a self confessed series addict who follows 20+ shows at a time and is constantly on the lookout for the latest episodes and the newest shows. The fact that it let's you tick off what you've watched and sync with trakt is awesome for keeping track of where you left off. It also tells you when a series has ended and when it's continuing. The show recommendations are a cool tool as well. App works like a charm - never failed me.

	   This is in my opinion the best app to keep track of all those TV show that you are watching. When is the next season going to start to when is going to be the next episode. The episodes you missed while you were away. Please support the app, pay for the subscription it's only a few dollars per year!

	  I found SeriesGuide to be the overall best app for tracking my series progress. The only issue I have with it is restoring backups. when i replace phones I've never been able to restore from .json files. I saved an earlier backup on cloud storage as well as the download folder but I always get the prompt "Restoring the backup failes". Thanks for the help. If backup function works (or the cloud sync feature) this app is easily worth 5 stars :)

	<comment>
	   Series Guide is a detailed and user friendly way to organize what you watch and when shows air. While there are some quirks in how special episodes are listed, especially shows with feature length specials or lots of behind the scenes features, it is overall a useful and well laid out application that helps track a wide variety of television and Web media.

	  There's a big problem with taking back ups. Either you should take them manually and restore it with a fine. Or you could back it up to cloud but it won't automatically restore from the cloud... Again it's manual.

	   Perfect combination of simplicity and functionality. Easy to use, does what it's meant to and has no extra garbage that no one needs. You can backup the data on cloud storage like Google Drive and restore on a new phone. Also the developer cares about improving the app regularly. I simply love that app!

	   Very useful in its functions but sometimes it just stops pushing notifications of my shows. Then suddenly it starts notifying. So I'll either miss one episode or get behind randomly throughout a season. But compared to the competition, it's probably the best.

	  I wish the integration with trakt was more seamless. I mean it doesn't sync ur watchlist automatically, u have to add the show manually in the app after adding it to ur watchlist in trakt. Also, the app doesn't always reflect changes made on trakt.

	   Finally I have an app that can quickly organise my shows and Movies that I watch. Its seamless intergration with Trakt is awesome so it means I rarely have to tick off anything in the app, its all done automatically. There are few times where my ratings on trakt wouldn't sync but overall a great app.

	   The app does exactly what I need it to. The only downside is if I add a show to the list that I want to watch in the future, and I have to change devices, as I did recently, I lost all of those show, since I had not watched any of the episodes.

	   I love using this app to make a list of shows I watch and see when new episodes are coming out. It's very accurate, telling you the time, day, and channel a show will be appearing on. I've also learned of special episodes that I didn't know existed before using the app, like the Breaking Bad and Dexter shorts online.

	   When I switched to iPhone for a year, I missed this app the most. Anybody who keeps up with currently running TV shows will love this app. I don't normally write app reviews but I had to make an exception for Series Guide. The developers have done a fantastic job. Well done!

	   I would give it 5 stars except I feel there are two very important features missing. First, you have to be connected to the Internet to mark an episode as watched. I wish there was a way you could be offline and still check in and the next time you were online it would then sync. Second, in the movies section, I wish there was another option other than watchlist and collection. I would like to be able to check off the movie as watched. Other than that it is a terrific app!

	   I love the integration with Trakt.tv, I can just add a new series here and scrobble it where I have my trakt.tv account. No more figuring out what's the last episode I saw!

	   I'm a LoveFilm subscriber so this is really handy for tracking where I am in various box sets I might be watching. Just be aware there are potential spoilers if you view future episodes.

	   Would love to buy the full version but the trakt sync never seems to work. Have to keep marking the same show as seen over and over again so just disconnect it.

	   As someone that watches a lot of TV from a broad range of sources this tool keeps track of everything I've watched and let's me know when new episodes will be /are released. It's integration with trakt is quite useful and it's total time watched is amusing. Highly recommended.

	<comment>
	   SeriesGuide is the only app I use for tracking my shows and for digging into characters, actors, directors and the lot. The extensions are very useful and, while it helps to have native apps installed like IMDb, they're not necessary with the ability to do quick web searches for shows and episodes. Integration with Trakt works well for me, though I've heard others moan about it. Also seems to keep me synced across multiple devices with no problems. Well done.

	<comment>
	   Have been using this for more than a year. It's quite helpful to keep track of series and pending episodes. I don't use the social aspect of the app so cannot comment on that. I have see d the evolution of the app and it has followed Android design guidelines since the past year. The UX has been simple and intuitive. One drawback is when you click a having seen an episode there is a lag in response.

	<title>AMAZING & RELIABLE APP!</title>
	<comment>
	   I have been using this app for several years now, across multiple devices, and I absolutely freakin LOVE IT! We "Cut The Cord" so to speak about 3 yrs ago to save money. Now I watch everything online w/the help of this app. It allows me to keep a library of all the shows I want to watch, shows when they will be aired, includes both series & episode summaries, allows me to create, sort & maintain lists of shows I watch, check boxes mark episodes as watched or skipped, I can rate episodes, leave or review comments. It is linked w/my Trakt aucct. as well as the cloud, is able to back up & sync w/multiple devices. It's AMAZING! Even before we cut the cord, I used this app, that way I never missed a show. If I seen a commercial for an upcoming series, I quickly add it to my library, that way 4 months from now when it starts, I won't miss it, I will know what channel, what time & date each episode is aired on, I can set reminders or just look at my list to see what's on tonight, or this week. I can even track movies keeping a list of what I want to see, what I have seen & how I rated it, as well as what I collect (or actually own) which is AWESOME! MUST HAVE APP for tv/movie lovers!

	  I love this app because it makes me keep track of everything I watch without me getting lost and forgetting which episode I am on. This app is useful especially for a person like me, who watches like 30 TV shows at once ahahah

	   Me gusta porque dice cuando inicia una nueva temporada y que d铆as dan mis series. Tambi茅n, te da una rese帽a de que trata el episodio sin entrar mucho en detalles. Me gusta que tiene la opci贸n de poner como ya visto el episodio. Es muy buena! La recomiendo. Gracias

	<comment>
	   I've been using this app for a while with great results, but lately I've been having loads of trouble with syncing with trakt. Since I only use the app to manage my trakt account from my smartphone, this has broken the app for me. However, the superiority of the interface compared with other apps that sync with trakt keeps me coming back.

	   I use this to track all our shows, both on Hulu and Netflix, as well as over-the-air broadcasts. My only complaint is that when I am watching series that are originally British, but being aired in the US, the dates don't apply (Houdini & Doyle is an excellent example of this, being aired currently in the US on FOX) but that's a really small nit-pick! One thing that would improve it is the ability to separate shows into our own lists.

	   Guys, seriously now, you screw the app up everytime you launch a new update. Now, every text in the app is backwards, like in a mirror. Its a great app otherwise, but those updates really upset users Iike myself. ------- Thank you for fixing the app so quickly. All the best!

	   Dear developers, I hope that you guys could also add "add to calendar" feature to the movie section. That would be super helpful. Thanks

	   I use this app since many years and I don't want to live without it. I watch so many series and I can't always remember where I stopped, so this App is just perfect to keep track of what episode I've watched or not. I also bought the X-Pass and it's a nice bonus, you don't really need it but I like to help the developer of this App.

	   I use this app to keep track of each and every show i watch. I never miss an episode of any of my shows thanks to this app. Also, I never miss a start date for anything that is coming off of a break in seasons. This is the greatest app for those who are avid tv watchers like myself.

	   Easy to use and quite fast. Some more features like category of the shows and help search similar genres would help. Regardless a good app.

	<comment>
	   This app is the best. I have an ever-growing list of movies and TV shows I want to see and this app helps me remember. I also love how it keeps track of when the next season starts so I don't have to remember all of the season premier dates! Keeps me from completely forgetting about a show in between seasons.

	  Great app to track shows you've watched and what episodes you left off at. Syncs with the trakt tv. You can rate shows and individual episodes, read a short synopsis of shows, episodes, and movies. You can search where to watch or download them. Create lists to sort what you've seen, haven't seen, and what you have collected. There are a few things that could be improved. The menus can be a little confusing at first. It would be nice to be able to open the shows from the add shows list instead of only being able to click add. An in app calendar would be great also, so you wouldn't have to leave the app or create a ton of events in your personal calendar, I would rather not have tv shows in my Google calendar, but would like to be able to see all the shows I track for the week or month on one page. I've tried a lot of other tracking apps and always come back to this one.

	<comment>
	   Please fix. Its showing seasons as already complete/ended when its actually still on going. Its messing with my tracking,might uninstall if not fixed as this issue defeats the purpose of the app / edit: Hi Uwe, an example would be the episodes in the Flash for the second season. Its shows that there are only 21 episodes but its actually 23.

	   There seems to be a problem with the episode numbering. For example, in the it shows that Game of Thrones has only 5 episodes, but the series has upto 10 episodes as the 6th episode was aired 2 days ago. This app is definite 5 star if this problem will be fixed.

	<comment>
	   Good idea, but doesn't work in the long run. I downloaded series guide, linked it to trakt and saved loads of stuff. Then I had to reset my tablet, logged back into the app and everything was gone. You'd think the lists would save to online, not the tablet. I'll be deleting this app now which is a shame as it had good potential.

	<title>It's a scam</title>
	<comment>
	   I had the free app installed in the past. Yesterday I was charged $2 for what? I am not usong the app and didn't purchase a thing from them. Now I have to call the bank and explain. I was not even using the app anymore. I installed it again today and there is no option within the app to see what I was charged for. Check your account statements for GOOGLE *Uwe Trottmann and you might have a surprise

	   Updated review for 2016. Excellent app with many great features. Great visual design that fits with new Android style. App is easy to navigate and simple to use. Features are occasionally added and tweaked to make it even more useful over time. If you like keeping up with many television series, I don't think there is a better way to keep track.

	<title>Good app</title>
	<comment>
	   While its a good free app to keep track of your TV shows, been a long time Apple user, I miss so much iTV shows. It was supper simple and clean. Granted that this app, has a lot more information, but if it had addtional to all the other options and screens, a mode to have a similar view to the one from iTV shows, I would give it 5 starts. It simple needs something to clearly display in one page, what's playing this week, another section below, for the following week, then another section below for what's due over a week, and another section below that with shows waiting to return, and finally another section at the bottom, for TV shows that have ended. That would be simple and consice. Additionally, displaying a number with the amount of episodes that you haven't watch yet, at the actual icon of the app, would be sensational. Just my two cents. All in all, a good app. Thanks and keep up the good work. Alan

	   I am using just the core of series guide. Only tracking my shows and that's it. Even though there are like 2 or 3 other tabs with different filter settings I still have to use a custom filter (unwatched+upcoming). So awkward! The "Lists" feature if completely useless and so is the Movies section. There are better apps that do it better. Connection to traktv was broken so many times that I stopped using it.

	<comment>
	   I've been using this app for years, and there is no better way to manage TV viewing on multiple devices. It helps me know what I've missed and what's to come, and when. Syncs with Trakt as well, which is awesome. I made few requests to the dev in the past, and those were implemented. I cannot recommend this app enough if you watch a lot of TV.

	   Though the Pro version of this app is pricey, I went for it. I actually don't use this app too much because a lot of the shows I watch have finished or are not ongoing, but it really helps to keep track of shows or movies that you watch.

	   So out of all the TV Trackers, IMO this is the best one. It looks great, the UI is very easy to use and even though it looks like a simple app, it does have a ton of customization options. And the X-Pass is great if you have multiple devices, or just appreciate the dev who single handedly made this.

	<title>Great app but requires binge watching option</title>
	<comment>
	   Hi there, it's a great app to keep track of tv shows.. But I believe a normal person, like me, doesn't really have the time on everyday basis to watch all the shows that air in a day, hence we binge watch the entire season when it's over... And I think that's something you should take into consideration... If a show is marked as binge watch.. Then it should not be listed in the recent/upcoming list.. And should give a notification when the current season is over. Add that and it will be a 5 star review :)

	   If I had the option to add TV Shows straight to my trakt TV Shows Watchlist, the same way it lets me add movies to my watchlist, then this would be a 5 star app but because this option isn't there, it makes it a little awkward to use for me :(

	  interface is pretty nice. with the dark theme even more so. frustrating thing is, syncing doesn't seem to work, i have it on 2 of my devices and sometimes i have to manually update the watched episodes then the widget since it does not update itself. It would be nice if the widget would be allow to refresh automatically.

	   I love this app really much. Few weeks ago it stopped working good, the episodes are not updated and I really though that season was ended because I didn't get update.

	<title>The BEST app for tracking the shows you watch!</title>
	<comment>
	   I can't recommend this app highly enough, both its design and function are top notch! Nice, visually appealing user friendly graphic interface, with a seemingly gigantic database of shows...I easily found and added everything I searched for, and I watch A LOT of different stuff! I strongly recommend spending the extra couple of bucks to get the "pro" version of this app called SeriesGuide X. It adds several incredibly useful features including additional widgets and upcoming show notifications.

	  Was my one of my fav's, widget not longer updates for days after marshmallow. Not hooked to trax or any of that, I just put enter my favorite shows and look at the widget to see what is playing that evening, Widget must be forced to update, installed, did not help, rebooted more than once, does not fix the issue, wrote to the author, never heard back. Paid for it, was five stars in my books till a few months ago.

	   I watch shows on Netflix and Hulu and am catching up on some series that started years ago. Some have already ended but I need to catch up. This helps me keep track of which episodes I've seen and which I haven't.

	  I am glad the developer listened to the feedback of myself and others. No more forced purple widget. We now have an option for a dark widget theme that can match most homescreen themes. But, the backup and restore feature doesn't work at all! It keeps failing. I have tried clearing the data and uninstalling/reinstalling the app but it still doesn't work.

	   This is a great app for us inveterate television viewers. Just select or search for programs you watch and it lets you know know when they're on next, as well as episode guides, synopses, and a check in feature. Easy to work and lots of fun. No more scrounging the listings. It has programs from all over the planet!

	   This is a brilliant app makes it so easy to keep up. Couple of things to make it better 1. If you could change the channel (example. when the show was on in America it was on AMC but in the UK its on sky1) change it to show what channel you are watching it on so it keeps it up to date. And the back up (I had to reset my phone after I backed it up and it didn't work so had to put all in manually

	  Seemed decent at first, but it got the scheduling wrong twice now and if it makes me check manually for when the next episode of some show is really coming, it becomes a useless app. Have to switch to something else now.

Alot of the shows i save dont show up in the widget for upcoming shows, like cops, wwe Monday night raw, wwe smackdown....please fix. Also I have the premium version, is thete a limit or something cause now when i click to add a show it doesn't save... It's giving me A lot of problems. Cant erase a show, etc...

	   The app is great to begin with. It has all (American - some others) TV shows & movies but it doesn't stay up to date which is why I downloaded it. Atm only a couple of shows are showing up whereas I know others are still running and it only says "no next episode found". If this were to be corrected, it would be a brilliant app.

	  I had no complain about the free app ever, but seriously? That transparent widget was the best! Now it only blocks my background. Why would you change it in the first place? Please bring back the transparent look of the widget or give us an option to choose. 馃憥edit to reply: Mr. dev, I don't think that option is available for the free app users. I've thoroughly checked after the latest update. edit again: I went ahead and bought this app from amazon app store.

	  I love this app, it is the best free app to track all the lot of TV series. You can use with or without other services like trakt, and it has no ads. however I wish the episode number was more visible. It is almost invisible to me. Where it says "season X episode Y"

	   Great app. Now it's not slow. Has nearly every show. Updates on time. Some things that could be added are:(1) a recommended TV show guide to discover new shows.(2) overhaul of the reminder system. All I want is a notification to remind me when an episode is going to start and not add it to my calendar. Just a reminder button on every show page should do the job. It's my favourite app till date, please consider the recommendations. Plus, thanks for no ads.

	   It's a mouthful trying to keep track of all the great series (and movies) especially when they span 4-7 seasons and several years between the first and final episode. This app is making it so much easier for me and my girlfriend to do just that. We can't recommend seriesguide enough; 6/5 stars! Frequent updates and the fact it's simply working so well is the reason we bought 2 x-pass versions (we use a free version on a secondary tablet as well, which work just fine although lacking the premium features)

	   I use this app to keep track of my movies I watch and own. It seems more geared towards TV shows but I hope it's expanded more for movies. Ability to add a custom genre would be great summer that's how I sort my movies.

	  I've loved this app for years. Unfortunately it's not been updating well, and the app's been moaning about Trakt connectivity issues. And it would be nice if Sort by Title would ignore the word "The" at the start of a title. I keep thinking I've lost shows out of my list, but then they're filed under T.

	  It is beyond annoying that this app becomes unusable if trakt has connectivity problems. Why is it not possible to just set episodes watched on device and let it sync whenever it can get a connection instead in real time.

	<comment>
	   Look the app is great. But the purple widget bar is the worst. I've seen many folks complaining about this and since then a new update had been released which I assumed would address this. But no. Look I'm not going to stop using the app but please just add a transparent bar option.

	<comment>
	   I watch a lot of tv, both current and older/done. Since the past 2 or 3 months everything really improved, sped up, no more lag. Runs great. I get the occasional movie that won't update, but they are harder to find movies. But I use it 99% for tv and it works great for tv. This is one of my go-to apps on my phone. Love it!

	   Tried a bunch of these show tracker apps and they were all pointless. This is the only one I found which actually tracks which episodes I've seen and keeps a continuously updated watch list of unseen episodes. No extra fluff. Just tracking of episodes in a simple and attractive app.

	  This is the very app that makes it impossible for me to switch to iOS. 100 percent material design sans memory hogging guarantees that it is awe-inspiringly beautiful and intuitive to use. This is the best of android embodied: genius third-party developer, open source, vibrant community, adherence to google guidelines.

	<comment>
	   I absolutely love this app! It keeps me organized when it comes to my weekly shows, and when I'm catching up on a series on the side. However I often encounter errors when it tries to communicate with Trakt. Suggestion: allow offline "Set Watched" options if there's connection issues, and send the data once a connection is established. Otherwise this app can be useless if Trakt isn't working right.

	   It works superb and is the best tv show tracking app on the market, but there are still a lot of shows that you can't find. For example "The Leftovers" or all the Digimon Seasons (it has only three randome ones). Please fix this!

	<title>Great app, but buggy recent view.</title>
	<comment>
	   I will give 5 stars once the following issue is resolved: On the recent section, when infinite calendar is selected, the app continuously cycle through each of my series showing every single episode as unseen when I have tagged all the episodes as seen and then removing then from the view. This gets annoying when some series have hundreds of episodes. Not sure if this is a syncing issue with trakt. I think this is also draining my battery.

	   After cutting the cord and jetisoning cable i was a little lost. It isn't always easy to tell when new episodes of your favorite shows are available! With Series Guide i can see each show, each episode, track what i have already watched, and even see if a show has been cancelled. Fantastic tool!

	   The app is really great but recently most of my tv shows have the wrong date to their next episodes, or even no date at all. That's really a bummer. (For example, The Voice, The big bang theory, the leftovers, the walking dead, etc.)

	<comment>
	   Because there are serious flaws ever since the last update associated with the add to calendar option where episodes are being added twice, episodes in the app will have the correct date, but are added to the calendar with the previous episodes info & date. Some shows in the app still have the wrong dates.

	   It's a great app, it allows you to follow your favourite TV series (or solve doubts as to the order of special episodes, etc.). There is only one series it doesn't have, but it's on tvdb rather than the app itself. It has now become a must-have.

	  The trakt interaction has issues about 50% of the time... although the website is working just fine. This is NOT the first time this happens. Can you finally put an end to this madness? Also, you've added color to the header inside the navigation view with the last update. Good job. But there's still no trakt image while logged in with trakt.

	   Been using this for a couple of years and it only gets better and better. I don't get much usage out of the lists and movies functionality but the TV tracking and episode information etc is fantastic. Topped off with a developer who gives clear information in descriptions about updates and provides good support and you definetly have a 5 star app.

	   The app needs to be able to tell you what episodes you haven't seen without digging into each show. Could be a percentage var on the shows screen, could be a new "unwatched" screen.

	  - Clean UI that conforms to Google's material design principles - Buttery smooth performance - Perhaps change the logo into a stylised TV? - Very easy to add series and mark episodes as read. - Higher resolution background photos for each episode would be nice, though I understand that this may not be a developer choice.

	<comment>
	   I don't particularly use the GetGlue parts, but this at least keeps me appraised if there is an episode coming up, or if I am catching up how many there are to go. I don't always know if a show is on hiatus or there is a holiday causing a delay. A good reference for Television watchers.

	<title>Best app on the market for keeping track of your shows!</title>
	<comment>
	   I'm just now getting around to writing a review, but before this app I had been looking everywhere for a good app to keep track of the shows and movies I watch (specifically TV shows though). After finding this I instantly fell in love and now most of my family uses it. Definitely worth the purchase to get the notifications (for me at least)!

	   I've used "Series" for a while now and it's been working awesome. It stays synchronized with all my movies and TV series on Trakt. Tried the others and not the same, this one looks beautiful and decent with material design. If you like to keep track of all the movies and series and even get ratings, this one works perfectly.

	<comment>
	   For TV shows (the main reason I installed the app) it is perfect. I can keep track of all the shows I watch so I never miss an episode. The only downside is the movies section. I don't go to the cinema so would like to see a blu-ray release date (even if that's TBA). Thankyou for a quality app :)

	  The feature set is fantastic. However, performance is atrocious. It appears to contact trakt, send changes, and wait for a response, before updating the UI. Actions as simple as checking a box can take 45 seconds, even on high speed wifi. Sometimes they never complete at all.

	   Statistics only counts the runtime of movies in the Watchlist, and it should count the ones that I set to "watched". Besides that I love the app!

	  Has many old shows I watch regularly (Columbo, Corner Gas) and works great offline. Dates and times don't match up with Canadian broadcasters, but I don't use it for scheduling - just for keeping track of the episodes I've seen and it's perfect for that. 5 stars!

	<comment>
	   I use this app for ALL my shows now, and never want to go back to the days where I had to guess or google which episode I was on. I truly wish, though, that Netflix original series were also included on here. I don't know which House of Cards episode we were on!!

	<comment>
	   Dont bother with this app any longer. Its slow as hell, ignores settings and i dont think there's a lot of work being done on it anymore. It also has a problem with wakelocks/power consumption. Tried it with several phones ROMs and kernels but at this point I give up and move on. The trakt mobile site has become excellent by now.

	   This is a hugely helpful app. It can be a bit slow to update and kinda sucks up my battery when it's syncing, but it's still very helpful.

	<comment>
	   I had been using this app for quite some time. Didn't open it for a few months, then open it again and all the shows I was tracking are gone and nothimg shows up. Not worth uaing if they made a change along the way that lost all my info.

	<comment>
	   I loved the old version that showed what the next episode for you to watch was even if it was weeks ago. I despise the new setup that shows you everything over the past month, even if you have it checked off as watched. I'm looking for a new app that does that because this new version is TERRIBLE.

	   Wow!! You guys be the bestt! :-) Keeping track of what to watch (and when) is no longer a difficult job.. I love your app and the fact that it shows timings in your country's zone gauge (and not in USA's) which is great and very handy. Plus, the widget is absolutely gorgeous! All in all, a job well done, developers!

	<title>Amazing app</title>
	<comment>
	   Everything is great about this. SeriesGuide Cloud works perfectly with X Pass and all the shows are synced with all your devices. Only two things I would consider fixing. Number one is the connection with Trakt, is mostly bugs and has some sync issues, but it can be as must Trakt's fault as it can be SeriesGuide's. None the less, I still prefer SeriesGuide to Trakt because of TVDB, which is almost used as a standard for TV shows information. Trakt has it's private database so sometimes it's information mismatch TVDB and some sync glitches appear. In the end, I stoped using Trakt. Number two would be to add a feature to set the episodes to re-watched (as many times you watched it). For now I just uncheck the Seen Episode when I re-run a series and check them back when I watched the episode, but as I said, a re-watch count would be great, especialy with the stats so they don't erase the time watched when unchecking the episode. (I'm not sure if i'm very clear, but you get the idea.) In conclusion, best app out there for TV show tracking.

	   But it could really do with the option to automatically mark an episode I've checked in to as watched. I'm not sure if this is a limitation within the app or a limitation of the trakt service. Edit: Trakt seems to do this on the website.

	<comment>
	   good app considering the alternatives out there. the main thing that bugs me though is the auto update doesn't really work. will find myself watching a show on tv thinking i've downloaded the latest (according to the app) only to find i've missed one or two episodes because the app hasn't updated itself to show the latest content - and that kind of defeats the whole point of the app.

	   Lots of shows i watch are not updating with current information. No point to this app if it can't tell me that my shows are on because all it says is "continuing" even though it's active...Face off on scyfy is an example. Uninstalled it after i missed two episodes with no update.

	   Great for keeping track of which episodes /series I've watched. Especially being in the UK with erratic release schedules for US shows. Not the fault of this app but the trakt api has been useless recently and you will get a much better experience by not connecting it.

	   Very useful. Do you think you can add the ability to add many instances of the same extension to a show or movie and name each instance diffetently? I would like tobe able to add many instances of kodi extension (one per my kodi installations) so I am able to launch a show via seriesguide on my mobile to the appropriate kodi on specific tv that I want (each kodi http server has a different ip as installed on a different tv box)?

	   I love this app, but lately the shows arent updating with the most recent episodes. Also, some shows aren't on here - empire is a prime example. If it were up to date with everything, I would easily rate it at 5 stars!

	<title>What is up with this app lately?</title>
	<comment>
	   I have been using Series Guide for at least a year now and up to this point I have loved it. But lately, I regularly have trouble syncing shows to my Trakt account (have to manually sign in and out only for it to work for a few seconds), and marking something as watched takes forever to take hold. This started happening a couple updates ago. (Problems exist on both my tablet and phone.) It's becoming more work of a headache to use than the headache it solves.

	   I'm in love with this app, but I have two problems. 1. You can only set watch a movie when you add to your watchlist. 2. The watch time for movies are only on watchlist and not on watched, I think the second one is more important. This 2 things will be incredible.

	   The app is a good deal. But it keep showing same posters of TV shows. It changes but once in a while. So a option to manually change the posters would do a great job. Otherwise this is maybe the best app out there for tracking TV shows. Cheers

	<comment>
	   This is by far the best TV show tracker, well designed and great features. The only thing I'd like to see is for show times/air dates to adjust for the locale of the user, e.g. show me when a US show will air in the UK and not the US. Though I do understand this would be difficult to implement and might actually be impossible.

	   Latest update: don't like the new tab. Just bring back History and Friends tabs. Previous comments: Was 5 stars easy. However currently shows are showing as watched in history tab but not watched in recent tab. Could be Trakt issues though I suppose. I assume Trakt are to blame for missing friend tab also.

	   This is just perfect for those who are addicted to TV series and specially for those who live outside USA/UK and it's difficult to keep a tab on when the new episodes are going to be aired.. just one thing though,it would be perfect if we get a push notification whenever there is a new episode being aired of the TV series added to the personal favorite list.

	<title>One more option</title>
	<comment>
	   I suggestion here is to put a new tab or just update a new option to sort according to the countdown in dashboard or another new tab to check how many days for our favourite next episode .. So if you add that one option, this app becomes perfect for me.. Here in this app we have upcoming episode options, but it's very limited to one or two months I guess.. When I open GoT, it says NO INFORMATION ON NEXT EPISODE where we all know it's coming this April..

	    implementation might as well not exist. All it does is let you look at your history. It doesn't even add any of your shows or movies.

	   An enormous list of shows and their air dates - although sometimes it has no air date or information and the synopsis are often vague, it also has the cool feature of notifying you when new episodes are airing, but you have to buy the subscription for that feature. Other than that, it's pretty good.

	<comment>
	   I have been using this app for nearly 6months. The issue with trakt has become horrible. All my watched episodes are unmarked. Same for the add to collection flag. TVShow time is much better! I would not want to migrate to a new app but, if this persists I will have no choice.

	<title>Rarely if ever works.</title>
	<comment>
	   I tried adding a shows to my watch list and marking some as watched. When it feels like it, the app works. It does not always sync to tract so I have holes between this app and the website.

	<title>Great App before Trakt sync was broken.</title>
	<comment>
	   Used the app for a long time now. The UI is good and it follows material design. There are plenty of settings to tailor it to your needs. However recently there seems to be a lot of problems with syncing to Trakt. Hopefully this will be fixed soon.

	<comment>
	   Thanks for your hard work! Still having issues with trakt, so I suggest keeping the data that didn't pass through, in a table and try to send it in the background, from time to time, but let us mark the show as seen, even while offline.

	   Liked the design and the fact the there wasn't any shows missing from the search. At least for me. Only thing I dont like is that app thinks that stargate sg-1's episode length is 45min and person of interests is 1h when they both are around 42-43mins(without the adds). When its fixed you'll get 5 stars.

	<comment>
	   This is a great app to keep track of what you've watched, where you are in a series, and when shows are coming back on tv. I use it track my shows on tv and netflix. One useful feature I think could be added is if you are up to date on a show that is still running. For example if I caught up to the most recent episode of "The Walking Dead" there would be something simple on the main screen of shows to notify me that I'm caught up on the show and the next episode hasn't aired yet.

	<comment>
	   This is a fantastic app to track TV shows that you've already watched and I also appreciate that it looks for the next airing for the episode you're currently on. BUT... the movie section could be improved. I wish it had two sections, one for tracking movies that you've already watched and one for the one you want to watch in the future. This would make the movie section more useful in my opinion.

	   Trakt has changed the runtime of the episodes of many TV shows reducing most of them. You need to take that into account and fix those times accordingly in this app.

	   Have used this on/off for years but have come to conclusion it's best out there, however why can't we mark a movie as watched like an episode then it would be fantastic!

	<comment>
	   For freaks like me who watch dozens of TV shows this app is vital. I'm currently tracking 50 series and this app makes that so easy to do. Simple layout and the dev support is great. Any time I've had a problem I'd usually get a response within 24 hours. The dates and times each episode airs is accurate. Just one important type of information among many this app provides. Thanks!

	<title>Current page when connecting to Trakt -- MINUS TEN STARS!!!!</title>
	<comment>
	   Irrespective of whether using android keyboard or third party, trying to enter credentials into app to connect to Trakt makes the data entry lines unreadable -- keyboard takes up half the screen -- doesn't work in main app -- but still what's the point -- there are now several apps permitting tracking of shows, so can't see the point of using this if you cannot enter ALL data correctly. ALSO app is VERY big -- 5 times the size of WatchSeries, say, and it should ALSO allow backup to external SD card -- we are using this on an Android device, after all!!!

	<comment>
	   My TV shows library/collection on trakt are not sync with this app. My upcoming section is just blank. My movies collection on trakt sync without any problems. Please give my the ability to sync my TV shows on grant with this app. Also it would be great if some kind of indication was added to let me know if I watched the movie/show. Cathode has it.

	<comment>
	   I love the style of the app, it's just confusing sometimes. I wish it was simpler, also options to add new content to Watchlists and Collections, without going into to many menus. I think both Movies and TV sections should be identical. Instead, to find my Collection and Watchlist in TV, I have to press Add button first, which doesn't make sense :P

	   Love the design and it's very easy to use. I will say one thing I would change would be having the widget be a past TV episodes with a check box next to it so you can mark as watched but also keep the option for upcoming. With my big phone screen I would have an entire page for widgets. Top would be upcoming and the bottom would be a need to watch or have you watched widget. Amazing app! It needs to have sync revamped. I bought a tablet and downloaded this and signed in to my trakt but it didn't sync.

	<title>The best tracker out there.</title>
	<comment>
	   I've never seen an app as good as this for tracking tv shows. But it seems to take too much time to update the shows and sometimes, if I mark the show as watched, it goes back to bring marked as unwatched. Also, I wish there was an option to create lists with movies as well. But still, you won't find a better app than this.

	   The FIRST trakt client updated for trakt V2. Fantastic. Purchase price a little high, really want to support dev but $8.50 feels expensive. The only thing I get by paying for it that I am interested in is different themes, even then there are only a couple. This is easily the best of this type so far. This really is a great app, excellent UI.

	<title>The best, no-BS TV show tracking of its kind</title>
	<comment>
	   It's not forcibly tied to any cloud synchronisation service. I find the interface simple and even the littlest of things paid attention to, such as adding multiple shows - you're left on the same screen and there's no clunky multiple selections, you just hit the nicely-sized "add show" buttons... Honestly, I wouldn't be as efficient when it comes to watching new episodes when they're out without this.

	   The last update screwed up syncing with trakt. All I get is errors now when I add movies to my watch list, or that I have watched a movie. Hopefully this is resolved soon or I'll switch to another app.

	   Very clean, intuitive interface. But it's slow to update and I keep getting "connect to a network" messages. The movie part is obviously an afterthought - you can't add them to lists or mark them watched. But it's good when it works, which is most of the time, and it does well what it says it does.

	   I love this app. It used to work like a charm. But since I started adding things to my collection my sync takes waaaay to long (probably months). My collection now consists of 13k episodes. I'd love to see a way to disable collection syncing with Trakt.

	   Great App. Helps me keep track all of the shows I am currently watching (which is 35 right now). I love how I can check which episodes I've already seen, get a brief overview of the next coming episode and have a widget that shows me the date and time the episode will be shown. I also love how this app recommends other shows that are popular on tv right now. I would recommend this app to anyone who is a TV fanatic like me.

	   I like being able to keep track of what I'm watching the stats are neat as well. Though the movie section needs some work. It seems like half the time the app doesn't recognize that I have set the movie as watched or even rated the movie. Though I don't know if this is an issue with the app or syncing with tract.tv.

	<comment>
	   Always happy to see updates for this. One thing that NEEDS to be introduced though is the ability to exclude a show from the manual time offset. I need an offset of -3 for displayed airtimes of North American shows to be correct, but this causes times for shows airing on foreign networks, such as BBC1, to be off -- it seems to adjust those for my timezone automatically for some reason. Definitely needs a fix, or it will only ever be "almost perfect".

	   This app is close to flawless. It's utterly indispensable to me because I honestly religiously watch 25 separate shows. Series Guide keeps track of them all: Name of the episode, Season & Episode number, Time & Date. The widget let's me know at a glance what's on that night and when. My most used app on my phone. I even keep my family member's shows tracked for them! Highly recommended. One issue I've found: American Pickers does not show up in the list widget.

	<title>Widget still useless</title>
	<comment>
	   Please add "do not show upcoming" to favorites widget. I don't care that another episode is coming in Tuesday. I just want to see what I still have left to watch. The widget is only useful as a queue. I don't know why anyone would use a widget for what is being provided already.

	   I like this app. I wish the widget was a bit more versatile. I wish it showed the option of what was up and coming and what I hadn't watched yet, maybe in a tab view.

	   I've tried most of the recommended Trakt apps and for me this is the best of the bunch. Nice interface, decent sync times and reliable. And if even if you're not a Trakt user you can still use SeriesGuide as a standalone TV show manager.

	   Decided to try another TV tracking app because the one I was using was crashing when I launched it. This one did the same thing. It won't even start. I notice both say they switched to trakt.tv. Is that why? Because it seems a horrible upgrade if the app won't work.

	   As a media enthusiast and binge watcher of shows on Netflix, I find it hard to keep track of everything I've watched. Thanks to this handy app though, I no longer have that problem. It also has fantastic descriptions and I enjoy the ability to add shows to your list and check them off as you watch them. This is actually one of the only apps that I use daily. Thank you, developers, fantastic job and impressive work keeping updates at frequent intervals.

	   This app helps tremendously when I get behind on shows or need to remember where I was in a series/what I wanted to start next. My only request would be a way of being able to share my data for this app between devices, as re-entering on multiple devices gets tedious.

	   Hi, it used to work with my samsung galaxy s4 & samsung galaxy note 8, but after i did a factory reset on both phones and then re-install the app once again, it won't add a show (too bad i didn't save the back-up file). i love this app so much and i'm considering on upgrading to pro, but if this thing won't get resolved i won't have any choice but to uninstall. Please reply/fix this issue. Thank you & more power!

	   I have been using this app for under a year now and have to it is just easy to manage and keep up with multiple TV series. On top of that it shows how much time you have spent watching. The new material design is just amazing works seamlessly. The themes could do with a few more options, but hey still an amazing app. Great work.

It looks amazing, everything has been kept up to meet Google's design guidelines, swiping is superbly implemented and the app performs without any issues. Support by the developer is also great. Definitely one of the best apps on the whole Play Store

	   Love the new movie watchlist. Is there anyway you could link this to an IMDb watchlist so if I updated that it mirrors it within the app. That would take it up a notch.

	   I have been using this app for longer than I can remember. It is one of the few apps that follows me from device to device. It makes keeping track of shows easy, specially for someone like me who has to download the shows I watch after they air. The developer is great and always responds to concerns. I follow him on Google plus to stay updated on the progress. I recommend buying Series Guide X to support the developer!

	<comment>
	   I used to write myself post-its listing the schedules of all the tv shows I watch, but no longer! No longer do I have to try to remember what night and time and network my shows are on, or figure out whether they even aired this week, or when the new season starts. This app keeps track of all of that for me! And if I fall behind on a show, I won't lose track of what episode I'm on because I can take a look at which ones I've checked off as watched in the app. It's absolutely essential for avid TV viewers.

	   A great app, helps you keep track of exactly which episode you need to watch in which order. One small downfall in my eyes- my phone was recently broken. I got a new phone and loaded this right up, but all of the data I had entered was lost forever :(

	   Now U can't even use the hardware search button at all U need to go through many slow touch screen menus in order to search an episode. Basic functions are no longer available search feature is now broken which shouldn't of been messed with in the first place. There shouldn't be an advanced Menu option for the Update & Update all in the Recent tab menu. Should of left the Update and update all where it was, under the root Menu and not in a sub menu.

	   So far so good. I just started using this to keep up with all my shows and make sure that i dvr them. Two ISSUES.. I wish the 'notify' option had more choices other than 10 mins or 60 mins before... How about 6hrs before and 1 day before... Your notification options are VERY limited for an app that i have chosen to pay for. And the notifications hardly ever work. So what's the point?? :-)

	   The app is stable and do the job of tracking TV shows and Movies pretty well. The navigation is not always obvious especially when you are browsing season episodes and want to go back to the season level or even above. Check-in traktv is good but can't check-out. Meaning episode remains check-in for ever .... in my case

	<comment>
	   I found it very useful especially in keeping close watch on all the Tv shows I follow. I would have given it five stars but I found some features on the app to be too perfunctory. Navigating on this app wasn't my best experience thus far. It could be a lot more simpler if improved on in future updates. Nice app to have, keeping!

	  Biggest annoyance would have to be the special episodes, any way you can add a thing to take them away? Like a toggle? Or have the skip functionality work on future episodes too

I don't use Trakt or getglue or any of that, but it's a pain that those paying users are the only ones who can back up there shows to the cloud. Every time I flash an updated rom I have to add all my shows from memory. Swear I'm still missing some...

	<title>Latest Update Ruined the App!</title>
	<comment>
	   I absolutely loved this app until the last two updates came out. After the first update, I noticed a significant delay from selecting "watched next episode" from my show list and the actual disappearance of the show down the list. The lastest update has made the interface unpleasant. I can no longer long-press on a show and quickly mark the most recent episode as read. I now have to select the show, wait for the episode description to load, find the checkmark and then navigate back!

	   Great easy way to keep track of what your watching and when. No more checking the DVR.guide or searching online to see if there is a new episode. Also makes staying up to date with all those awesome cable shows with their on and off again mini seasons manageable.

	<title>The best way to keep track of your shows.</title>
	<comment>
	   I use this app daily. It's the best way to track your shows to see what's on, coming on, or when it'll be back on. It has a ton of features like cast, ratings, air times, original air dates, and much more. The new cast feature being fully integrated is fantastic! I've had this app for a long time and plan on getting many more years of use out of it. Without it I would've missed many season premiers of my shows that I just plain forgot about. Thanks for the awesome app!

	   Include details of all tv series, being aired or not does not matter, as I like to mark watched series n look for 'to watch' series using this app, appears that few series are missing in the list and provide option to choose Country or Worldwide option for finding TV series.

	   Keeps me posted on what shows are coming out, what I missed and get to stream. My only complaint about this app is I can't(or it isn't clear how to) add shows to the list, but it's a strong chance I've over looked it. Nice work dev!

	   What happened to the widgets? It no longer shows upcoming episodes. Tried to uninstall it, clear cache etc and nothing.. I hate the fact I have to open the app and look at the list of the shows to find out when the next episodes are due. Please fix it ASAP.

	   Few reasons why I stick to SeriesGuide over other similar apps is because it changes the episode release time according to country which no other app does and is smooth and has wide variety of options. Adding and removing shows are also very easy. Helps me keep up to date with latest shows to watch.

	   Love this app and can't find another that tracks my show progress as well. BUT it would be nice if it were faster to update, faster to navigate. Sometimes after marking an episode as watched it'll take a good 5 seconds before the screen changes to show the next episode :/ but over all excellent app!

	   This app looks good but that's about it, everything is a bit of a mess in my opinion, when clicking on an already added show it doesn't come up on the first tab? I started of with history and a watchlist tab now suddenly vanished whist looking everywhere trying to find out how to actually use them. No easy way to delete lists created. Not sure why you would need so many lists in the first place, this coming from a person who does keep track of everything. The fact you have to pay for the simple functions!?!

	   . So many shows and so little time to watch. App helps me remember. Love the widget which let's you know which shows are upcoming and on what network. The app itself is great allowing you to add shows to your list and check off which episodes you've watched. The pictures of the shows are not appearing anymore

	<comment>
	   Preciously I could long press on a series name in my list and select Watched Next Episode. The long-press function appears to have disappeared. Instead there is a tiny three dots icon which offers the same menu but even though it seems to mark the next episode as viewed, the series image never updates with the name of the next episode unless I open the series and close it again.

	   This app was great but since the last update I get constant 'unfortunately, series guide has stopped' messages. Even when I'm not actually using the app. I hope this gets fixed soon and I'll change my rating to 5 stars again. (using GS4).

	   Keeping track of your shows has never been easier. In an age when 'Marathoning' popular shows on Netflix/Amazon is a common practice, look no further. Full episode lists for every show, summaries, even ways to watch them.

	   Very good app for keeping track of episodes watched and when they are next on. Could be improved by allowing different regions to be set as few shows air here in the UK in line with the US

	   Neat UI & features. However, there should be a feature to add shows & episodes directly from 'Lists'. Sorting should also be improved. Custom sorting in the 'Shows' and the Lists segments should be there. Furthermore, the logo could be changed to something sleeker and more unique. Hope these will help improve the app and provide better amd easier services. Good work and keep improving. :)

	  Very useful if you are trying to keep track of what episodes of what shows you have watched or have not watched. Also has other features like IMdb, TVdb, etc. Although one thing I'm not sure about. It shows the word ended our continuing next to the fan art. Does that mean for the season or forever as in canceled?

	<comment>
	   Just got a new phone and all my data was synced except the shows I had added, don't really use the trak site so a good feature to add is when you sign into the app to make it add back all the shows u had instead of you going back to add all the shows over again individually....also it seems that not every TV show from each network is available to add or update, mainly MTV2 with some of its new shows like "jobs that don't suck" nd some other shows like "ain't that America" nd "Charlemagne & Friends"....

	   Great tool to keep track of each episode of your favorite tv shows that you just watched. Also provides preview of future episodes. Love how each episode has air date, as well as synopsis. Also, the app is very user-friendly. Would give 5 stars if app had sync feature. Otherwise, totally recommend this app! Droid Bionic =)

	  Definitely the most useful app on my phone. There is no way I could keep track of all my shows otherwise. The redesign is nice although the scrollbar is not really needed or should at least be smaller. If you choose to keep it, it really shouldn't show if there is nothing to scroll.

	   I value a good tv show tracking app and this one is getting better . this might be nit picking . When you list your shows . the name of show is bright white . name of episode medium white . third line , the date in dull white . perfect . don't like when you list upcoming or recent , that all changes . Really good app . just do not like that one difference .

	   This was great! My favourite app untill it almost completely stopped doing its job. It tells me it doesn't know when the next episode will be out when the shows are still being released weekly. Iv had to rely on another app to keep me up to date. Will uninstall soon if the issue isn't fixed.

	   It doesn't sync between devices, meaning that my Trakt reflects no changes, which makes it significantly less effective. I have to manually correct my progress continually. I subscribe to X pass, but I really don't know why. I am definitely annoyed with having to remember where I am in a series to manage the app, when the app is supposed to help to manage remembering where I am in a series, especially after not watching a particular series for months or years at a time.

	<comment>
	   This app syncs with trakt.tv which makes it very easy to keep track if you watch a few series from different sources. It is fast (very, if you consider trakt.tv can be slow at times) and layout is not overwhelming with information you don't need.

	   For example, this weeks walking dead 4x12 airs on Sunday 9 EST, but the app says it airs Monday midnight. Next weeks episode airs at 11 PM on Sunday.

	   This is hands down the best app for keeping track of when the TV shows you watch are coming on and also keeping track of what episodes you have watched.

	<comment>
	   Removed the way to sync up manually when the app wasn't syncing properly. Some episodes don't sync and that was the only way to resolve it. Downgraded to the old version until it is fixed.

They have move the list menu back on the main page, no need to go to menu for left menu to see upcoming and recent shows. Just swipe right and left to switch tabs.

	   Worked great for a long time. Then in 2014 shows stopped updating. All shows now say continuing.wtf. its as if they just stopped maintaining the app. Some shows still are up to date. But most have missing or no info. I hope they fix issue. 5 stars if they fix issues.

	<title>Okay but鈥u003c/span> I've used this app for at least a year. I do like it but it's not always accurate. For one thing, one program will only appear on a channel I don't get. There is no option to choose a different channel. I would like to rely on this app to remind me when programs begin a new season but it doesn't work that well. I also like PBS programs but there is no option to add certain titles within a series, i.e. Masterpiece Theater. Any suggestions? Full Review</title>

	   SeriesGuide is the best TV tracking app available. It's fast, smooth, and much more stable than the others. My only complaints concern minor design details. I think the icon is ugly, and that the app would generally benefit from having less purple.

	   When you watch more tv series than one, this is the way how you can keep in mind how many episodes you've watched. But the most awesome thing about this is that it reminds you when the new episode is on-air!

	   I was watching a lot of TV shows and keeping track of what episode I was on with a Word document. I thought that maybe someone made an app for this purpose and I found this app. It works pretty well and I love it.

	<comment>
	   This app is by far the best app to help you track your favourite shows so you can easily get caught up to the current episode if you ever miss one. It includes 3 sizes if widgets that display upcoming episodes. The design is very clean and modern, though the layout takes a little getting used to (a small price to pay for great power). Better support for movies would make this 5 stars for me.

	   Unfortunately for me, I love television! This app is nearly perfect for keeping track of your favorite shows. I love this latest update giving you the ability to update your watched list from the recent and upcoming lists only. If there was one thing I'd suggest is giving the ability to only see upcoming shows for 7 days or so...but that is so minor. Great job on an awesome app!

	   Beautiful app! I subscribed to get notifications. I second the suggestions of others... allow time zone change. My notifications are off but I have compensated. Would just be more convenient. It would be great to have a web-based associated software to work with it on the PC for quicker organization. Maybe a Chrome extension? Thanks so much for this app! Makes my life easier.

	   The app does what it says and does it fairly well. I do have a few suggestions though. Include Netflix and Vudu to the "Watch" links. Allow option for setting local time zone instead of defaulting to Pacific. And although I think the app looks just fine (I like the Android Dark theme), I'm not a huge fan of the icon. Also, I'm unsure what some of the buttons do when you tap them, there is no feedback other than a color change to indicate the action.

	<comment>
	   Great tool to keep track of my favorite shows; but it only works for a single unit. Nowadays, a lot of people have more than one device, and updating watched shows on each one is a waste of time. I wish I could create an account where I could log in in each device and it would sync whatever I entered in either one.

	   Regarding the widget; on my Tablet Z it causes the launcher to stutter every time I swipe past a homescreen with a SeriesGuide widget on it. Perhaps related to widget refresh intervals? I'd love to see a fix for it :) Helps me keep track of recent and upcoming shows in a beautiful way. Keep it up!

	   This app is there when I need it the most. As I don't watch any shows live so it helps me keep track of all I've watched and all that I haven't. It tells me when the next episode is coming out and a brief review of what will be in it. It's just awesome!!!!

	   Great app, and helps no end in keeping track with new and old shows. Only thing that's missing is a "filter by collected" option, as I would only want to see episodes I haven't seen that I actually have. When that feature is added, it will be 5 star app ;)

Pretty good suggestions based on your viewing habits, but they're extremely limited and effectively static since you cannot remove shows you aren't interested in from suggestions/etc. The only other negative is the lack of the trending movie feed that shows get. Once those two things are fixed it'll be golden.

	<comment>
	   Before getting rid of series guide x, there was an "upcoming/unseen" list. Now it's just "upcoming" that shows you upcoming shows even if you still have some to watch. The old list was much nicer.

	<comment>
	   This app has great potential but poor execution. And I fear that the developer has left us high and dry. There is no excuse for giving a half-year of series information. If you are going to include a series, using TBA for a half of the year is simply not excusable. For example AMC's "Hell on Wheels" aired its Season 3 finale tonight but the app only has half of the year updated. And there are plenty of other examples of the same or worse. Sad.

	   It baffles me why a program with the scope of this one would need such far reaching permissions. It's otherwise functionally well executed, but I don't need it enough to not care about bizarre permissions requirements.

	   I was hoping this program would help keep up with ALL television series, not just a portion of what's being aired now. Vintage shows do appear, but little else that would interest me. Five stars for a good product...but I'm uninstalling and looking for something beyond what this app offers. Thanks.

	   Love this app. It's perfect in every way but one. The backup process is extremely painful and I couldn't get it to work. If you could possibly add some sort of syncing tool through a google account then this would be perfect. Having said that, this is a pretty minor quibble for anyone that doesn't regularly change devices.

	   Add a button to check as "Viewed" all the episodes in a show that have aired until NOW, not just all the episodes in a season. This button would check all seasons until now and ONLY check as "Viewed" the episodes in the current season that have been already aired on tv.

	   I absolutely love this app! Only 1 problem that sometimes the app header, with back button and options, disappears. If I tap over it, it appears again. Please fix this, it can be annoying sometimes. Also marking "Watched all" can bug resulting in 0x0 not changing at all and showing no episodes watched. 4 stars for now.

	   Very reliable app! I depend on it for my show times. Two things I hope can be improved. One: It would be nice if it could update my Google Calendar automatically. Two: The option to choose a new show based on a network rather than new overall. For example, Continuum is shown first on Showcase in Canada, I don't have Showcase. However It comes on SyFy a few weeks later as a "New" show. What I would to be able to do is to be able to Choose the airings from SyFy rather than Showcase. I suppose what could be done is have the option to have your preferred Networks/ Channels. Hope I'm not asking too much as really already love this app!

	   Very good app to keep track on your TV series! The only feature I am missing is a calender view where you can see all upcoming episodes the following month!

	   This would be so much better if it had timezone correction built into it especially since its soldiers on google around the planet. I get tv show notifications a day earlier, so thank god I still have my iphone and tvshow tracker which has time zone correction...... Thanks for the reply, I found it in settings but got myself confused between 2 different apps, apologies.

	   Amazing app, especially for those who download torrents. I ended up purchasing the upgrade, purely out of gratitude for the app, but I don't see much use in it. So save your money unless you'd like to just donate the .99垄 like I did. Still, really great app. Absolutely worth the download.

	<comment>
	   I upgraded to the paid version of the app to support the developer. Unfortunately I followed the developer's instructions on updating the app from within the app verses through the Play Store which means uninstalling the app to repair an issue means having to repurchase the app. I have contacted the developer twice on Google + as this is the written preferred mode of contact for issues. To date I've received no response. I would not recommend this product or any or project from this developer.

	   I think this app is incredibly useful. The widget puts a list on my desktop that shows me exactly when all those new episodes I forget about actually are on. The time saved trying to Google these things individually is easily worth the free app.

	   I've been using this app for quite a while and never thought to rate it. Today I will, and I must give it 5 stars, because 6 is not available. I think I tried close to all the series tracker apps on the Play store but none of them I like more than this. 1. Interface is beautiful and easy to use. 2. Layout for episodes etc... ah what the heck this app is PERFECT! Download it. Now.

	<comment>
	   Well it lacks, for me at least, some basic features and customisation. One thing to set it apart from any tv app I've tried would be UNSEEN/UPCOMING widget, not only upcoming or recent. Also the ability to mark an episode watched from the widget! A real cherry on top would be the ability to customize the widgets layout,colors,transparency etc. I really want to use this as it looks great, I'm used to it, simple connection with trakt,but it's lacking just too much for me.Hope to see something in SGX at least!

	   Love this app. It is a great way to keep track of shows you are watching or have watched. Love the Statistics feature. I would rate 5 stars if you could add stats per show as well. How many watched how many left, run time of watched runtime of total series. Is this something you could add?

	   This app really helps me keep track of shows that my wife and I watch. We don't have cable and watch all of our shows on demand on the net but it's hard to know which ones have already aired or are coming up and which ones we've already seen. This app fills in my calendar for me, reminds me and even helps me track the ones that I've viewed. It's a great time saver and even helps me discover new shows and now movies. Really, really enjoy this app.

	   Been looking for something like this for ages. Can keep track of when all of your favourite shows are on and add them to your calendar in one click. You can also keep track of all the episodes you have watched of each show. It has most TV shows too.

	   Maybe I'm missing something, but I see no way to remove shows from my list. A couple shows are over and I no longer need/want them on my list. Another I added by mistake. It would be nice to be able to remove shows to reduce clutter. Otherwise a 5. Update: 5 stars now after developer replied. Excellent!

	   I like very much this application. I use it a lot to track my series, but the last change to limit the recent activity to a month was not a very good idea, in my point of view. At least an option should be available that permits us to see everything again, if wanted to.

	<comment>
	   Truly is a useful app for people who enjoy lots or maybe just a few selected television shows. At first I was hesitant in using this app thinking it would be only useful if your location is somewhere in the States , but found that my prayers to the Cable Gods in Programming were already a step ahead of me. I've had maybe 1-2 shows off on the scheduling but that could be due to a number of reasons...as for availability of programs to add to my Tele guide they're all here and the ones I couldn't find I just searched and walla...Game of Throne, Walking Dead your popular ones as well as your retro shows Different Strokes, Knight Rider & even M.A.S.H. are all here.....this is by far the best guide out there to date....keep up the great work.

	   This app is brilliant! Lets me keep up to date with all the shows I'm watching and lets me know where in the season I am with the show. It also tells me when the next episode is going to air which works great!

	   I was looking for a replacement for the osx/iOS TV forecast app, and found series guide. Not only is it a better, faster app, but the feed made it really fast to enter all my shows, and the activity view is wicked. I would pay $$$ for this.

	   Great for seeing what shows are coming up and tracking which ones I have yet to see. I keep it handy on all my devices. Only one caveat is that synopsis are only as good as those that are entering in traktv. Some are left blank and not supported well.

	   Interface is a little hard to get used to. Search function is a little wonky as if you aren't in the right section to do a "show" search it will just tell you not found. I don't even know what list is what or how to switch. It's also hard to figure out how to get to the main menu, or how to even use the list features.

	   If, like me, you watch your favorite shows when you want (rather than when TV channels expect you to) it's easy to forget where you are on any given show. This app helps to keep track of each episode and season. It's easy to use and allows you to backup your selections. It's free and well worth the download.

	   Hey, what would be cool is a way to input a url so I could click on it and go to the site that hosts the shows I watch. I can't access Google Play or Amazon for TV here in Canada. but being able to put in a link to the site (e.g. ctv.ca or tsn.ca) would be very helpful. Thanks for the great app

	   You don't actually watch any of the shows, you just see a recap of the show. This app keeps track of the shows you've watched, to ensure you've seen all the episodes.

	   This is great. I'm worried that my dvr will not record shows and I will not even know they have passes. I frequent about 10-12 a week, lame I know, but it passes the time. I love the sliding menu implementation. Works great!

	   This app is what I have wanted from tv tracking for ages. It tracks your series that are airing, allows you to rate shows in a series or episode level, links to amazon Hulu and imdb so you can watch digital downloads and get glue so you can be social in your laziness. LOVE it!

	<comment>
	   This is among the top 5 most useful apps I have ever used. Not only that it works great, looks great, it's easy to use. I like the dark there it has, it's tablet optimized, it had a huge selection of anime. I watch some pretty rare stuff and it has it all. I really can't find any complaints. If they make it better I'd be very surprised.

	<comment>
	   Good app, but the recent calendar needs more settings. 1. Define "recent" - some of the shows on that list aired in 2004. 2. Ability to remove past unwatched episodes from list. For example, I started watching "New Girl" but I don't intend to ever watch the episodes I've missed... I just want to keep current.

	<title>Exactly What I Needed</title>
	<comment>
	   For years I've been using text documents (notepad or google docs) to manage what shows I had watched, am currently watching, or plan on watching. This app, at it's core, gives me a much simpler way to keep track of my shows. There are a ton of additional features that I have absolutely no use for, but they don't get in the way of how I use this app. Only real issue is that sometimes the information is inaccurate. It may list an upcoming episode when there is not one, or it'll list an incorrect date, or other various bits of misinformation. This is obviously a fault with whoever is in charge of the server that the data is pulled from, but I'm not sure who is in charge of that server.

	<comment>
	   Show times and episodes were very wrong. Weird time settings, set to only show New episodes, (or I think I did, since the English is a little odd), it shows Castle is on Monday which is correct, but it says the episode is from 3 years ago, I checked tv guide and this app is wrong, there is a new episode, so not only does it show the wrong episode which the app says is a repeat, (it shouldn't even show up), I say complete failure.

	<comment>
	   Switched after TV Show Favs broke down, and so far it hasn't disappointed. Sleek UI (a little unintuitive at times, but good enough and probably just needs some getting used to), and very complete. The widget needs work though: resizing, adjusting transparency, adjusting number of shows showing, etc. Just give us some options. Do that, I will purchase the full version, as this is a great app for junkies like me.

	   Great App for TV Junkies! Exactly what I needed. Same as a previous reviewer, I tend to have a few shows on the go and lose track of what I've been watching and when new seasons start. I'm going to download the paid version because it's well deserved.

	   This app falls under the category of didn't know I needed it but now don't know how I could live without it! I love managing series and adding next episodes on my calendar with a reminder. No more missing a show that went on a week or so hiatus and a new episode pops up out of the blue.

	   I don't tend to review much but I think this one deserves it. As a series watcher that is often behind the broadcast curve this is invaluable in keeping track of my progress through classic serials (and some not so classic rubbish!) The Getglue integration is outstanding and the App is well worth a look.

	<title>New episodes only option?</title>
	<comment>
	   I don't use traditional tv, only web based services, so tv listings are of marginal use. If I had found an option to show me only new episodes, I would have kept it.

	<comment>
	   Just what I have been looking for, found it using BAM (Best APPs Market) APP. User creates an account (to get access to show listing), can be set to sync on wi-fi only (to save battery power by syncing quickly when at home instead of out and about over DATA CONNECTION). Select your shows, Select ALL Episodes and it gets a list of the episodes by season, it shows a synopsis of each episode, and simply "check off" the episodes you have seen.

	   Really helps to keep track of what we are watching and when the next episode airs. Even Naruto is there, every series you watch is there with every episodes air Date. We can mark which all episode we have watched and it shows when the next episode airs. Also there is a backup option too! Great app. Nice interface. No problems so far.

	<comment>
	   This app works exceptionally well. Very fast and smooth and I love the layout. The only thing that would make it perfect, would be if the widget had the option to show only the latest, single, upcoming episode for every show, e.g. If you're starting an older series, only show episode 1 or 2, or whatever you haven't watched. One more thing, I love the light theme, but is it possible to have other main colours than dark blue? Like red, or Google holo blue? Great app!

	<comment>
	   This app is perfect for me and saves having and updating these lists in Evernote. Unless I've missed it in there, for shows like the Simpsons, Family Guy and many others, it really needs to have the production code of the episode. This would save a lot of cross referencing and would make it unbeatable in my eyes. Maybe also have the option to remove the next showing date for those of us not in the US.

	    aren't up to par. A few new series just aired such as The Haunting of. There are now 6 episodes so far and series guide only list 4. And storage wars New York hasn't even started yet and it lists 2. And then there are series that can't be found such as Tickety Tic. My daughters love it and so far there are 12 episodes that I know of and every time I do a search its not recognized.

	   I love this app and it's working perfectly. One thing I hope you add it in the next update, which is in addition of marking an episode as watched there is an option to mark a season or bunch of selected episodes as watched. It takes time to go all over them one by one.

	   Absolutely fantastic app!! Really useful as I only watch prerecorded programs and it had previously been impossible to easily track progress - now it's simple, elegant and very informative with episode info for each program.

	   Love it, maybe the seasons could go into categories though, as its hard to click all the old seasons i have seen. I like my interface clean so when i have a ton of old episodes that i have to click one by one to get rid off its abit annoying, especially since i have so many different series.

	   Does exactly what I was looking for - keeping track of what episodes I've watched of my shows, and which ones are coming up/I haven't seen. Also gives a brief summary, which is awesome if you forgot what happened last week! I LOVE IT - gonna buy the paid version, one day...

	<comment>
	   Although it may be a good idea, there are some services that should be integrated into the app, like Get Glue. I understand that the information will be improved, but i must say that it is not so difficult to get more info on thr Internet about old episodes. Series should be divided into new ones and oldies, so that they don't mix with the followed shows

	<title>My Holy Grail App!</title>
	<comment>
	   This app is exactly what I wanted. If you watch several different shows and are catching up on past seasons and then you sit down and can't remember where the hell you left off, this is what you need. Very cool! A feature I would like added is information about where the episodes are available. (Netflix, Hulu, etc.)

	   Useful, great UI, fast, customizable and well supported and updated. Uwe Trottmann should be hired by Google to teach other devs how to do a decent app for Android tablets. Just purchased the paid version, devs like this should be supported.

	   Looks great now with the new themes, great feature set, and the data is accurate. This is the best app for keeping track of my favourite tv shows on android. And the pro version is very cheap and well worth the purchase.

	<comment>
	   It's a great app for keeping tabs on shows that I watch. The checkin function for Getglue is quite buggy and needs to be fixed. In most cases, checkin fails and it tells me to log in again. As an avid Getglue user, I find it pretty annoying.

	   UI is intuitive for the most part. It's kind of confusing once you've added the shows you want to keep track of. Mainly its a sequential thing, where the steps involved to see the current days programming isn't intuitive. That page should be the default once all the programs are added. But still this is niggling over minor issues.  app. Get it. I've used it every evening since I got it.

	<comment>
	   The only thing this seems to do is countdown the time to the next episode of a current series. There are buttons galore that don't seem to do anything but ask you to check in. And when i check in I see i am already checked in. I have the option to leave a comment but for what? A tweet of my opinion of the whole series? What good is this for all the shows I ticked off that are no longer on the air. It doesn't know who my program provider is. So how is it going to tell me when my show is on really?

	   Great app, sleek interface. I would love to be able to "see" all oast episodes with a click, if I'm adding a new series to the app that I'm up to date with. Annoying to manually check all episodes of 5 Dexter seasons for example.

	<comment>
	   Without real sync capabilities with trakt, this app is frustrating. If you want to keep track of TV watching on multiple devices, use Traktdroid instead. It has true syncing and a more intuitive interface.

	   Beautiful app that allows me to track shows I've watched and times of upcoming episodes. The app is fairly new and so it only shows American TV stations. If Canadian TV stations are added, I would definitely give it a 5-stars and upgrade to SeriesGuideX!

	   This app is very good, but TV Show Favs is great and with much simpler interface. Hope these two will continue to compete, cause I will continue to follow updates.

	<comment>
	   This is a great idea and could replace a service like tivo or sky plus (if you happen to be in all the time), but unfortunately it only uses American channels for American shows and when there is a British programme it has the time set as if you are in the US.

	   The app does what it says it will do. You can see which episodes you need to watch and when the next one is on so you don't forget. However, shows produced outside the UK tell you the American broadcast date and channel, so it would be nice to have full UK support.

	   Does what it says. Came for The Walking Dead, which was on top of search list (like app would read my mind). Overall I'm very happy with this app, has lots of features that are very handy while you are such maniac for tv series like me.

	   Helps me keep track of all the shows I watch and let's me know when the new episodes come out. The one feature I'd like to see is synchronization between devices.

	<comment>
	   I love the app! I soley use it to see when my favorite tv shows are airing next and not for keeping track of what episodes i have already watched. It would be awsome if you added a "hide check marks next to show info" to make the ui just a tad more clean. Also maybe add a option to make the upcoming episodes tab default instead of the shows you have added.

	   Very handy. Only thing I'd like to see is a cross sync between many devices. Ie, that if you update or add a show on one device, the others will know it.

	   If I have a trakt account already, it's painstakingly annoying to have to add everything onto my phone individually. That's why I have trakt in the first place, so that I only have to do that once. Needs better sync.

	<comment>
	   For popular U.S. shows, the app is fine. Anything outside the U.S. is very out of date. Especially anime shows.

	   I am rating it 3 stars due to the issues I've noticed. When adding new shows I get some unknown error adding a show 25% of the time and sometimes have to retry 3-4 times to make it work.

	   ... with this app. The more I use, the more I approve. Great layout, graphics, & show summaries. Watching "Lost" again from begining...this makes it easy & more enjoyable. Sleek color scheme. Very user friendly. Landscape vs portrait display when in Overview section is another unexpected touch showing Dev's detailed creativity. DEV: send to SD great...but then no widget BAD :-( maybe a separate widget then link??? Add On Screen Back button or swipe pleeeeez! Overall I say well done!

	  Loving this app. The posters are brilliant, and I like the fact you can deselect repeating episodes. No notification settings though... I'll see.

	   Would like to see cast photos used somehow, the ability to choose between show posters and a grid poster view. Refresh and update having the same symbol confused me [especially the menu button saying update on it but the appearing box saying refresh] I was long clicking individual shows to update until I realised. Auto refresh on widget would be good and the button doesn't seem to work until you've done it in the app.

	   I really don't know how I managed with this app. Up till now it was all by memory or updating notes in Outlook. This is a must have if you are a TV show freak and you don't want to miss the next episode. Also useful for avoiding repeats being that you can check off what you have already seen.
