	   This app only regurgitates what the estimated online schedule says. We need an app that can track buses in real time so we know when one is late or broken down or does not exist. Hopefully in the future georgia transit will get there act together and do this.

	   Some of the buses won't even show up on the schedule until it actually comes. You can't even tell if the bus had left or yet to arrive because it's so faulty.

	   This never used to happen but for some reason it's happening a lot lately, a bus will be so many minutes away with a big delay, next thing you know, a minute before it's usually due, the delay disappears, and it's due in a minute. Then after a few minutes somehow the delay is back and it's still not due. This has costed me so much money taking Ubers

	   Most of the time it helps a lot, but every time I have to walk 3 blocks to my bus stop and even getting out of my house 10 mins before, the bus still comes before it said on the app. It's freezing cold outside so it would be good if the time would be correct on the app

	   Too often the arrival times shown in the app are off quite a bit compared to the arrival times displayed at the stop. Wasn't the case until recently. In particular this is with route 215. If we can land a probe on a passing comet then we can have accurate arrival times people...

	<comment>
	   If all you want is location of bus stops and route maps this app will probably be fine. However, I can get all that from static pdf files. The lack of real time bus tracking makes this app barely worth the space on my phone.

	   It would be better if it can automatically pinpoint the map to my current location when I switch back to this app the next morning. Besides, this app sometimes keeps the location service active therefore drain my battery.

	   This unable is so unusable the is horrible service around town and who ever had the bright idea to make this app good try but maybe do your homework next time. This took forever to download and in another dimension took forever to load one stop. This app is worthless I preferred the texting app this just drains my data and then doesn't work. I'll try to reload again but not looking forward to getting my hopes up. Next time fully check all networks and locations before forcing everyone to use an app.

	   I'm in Seattle and if you want an app to tell you that a bus is coming in 10 minutes, and then switch to 25 minutes, and then back to 10, and then back up to 25, and then 2 minutes later for the bus to show up then this is the app for you. It is almost never correct, and you are better off just going to the bus stop without checking this app so you don't get disappointed!

	  Very reliable (usually) bus information. It can't get information on every bus status, but does a reliably good job and helps me ensure I don't miss a bus. They continue to improve the app and I've noticed the accuracy of bus times has improved. It's not 100% accurate and I've had a few times of waiting for a bus that it said was arriving that didn't, but I don't believe those were the fault of the app.

	<comment>
	   As a long time bus rider this app is terrible. Recently had to start using the bus again and live right in front of a stop. Decided to pull this app up and it tells me my bus is on scheduled arrival in 4 minutes. So I grab my jacket and head out. After sitting there for a few minutes waiting for my bus to come down my neighborhood, I see it leaving up the back! Then I check the app and it says it departed my stop 3 minutes prior, on time. The next one doesn't come for another 30minutes. Making me late!

	  This has been an invaluable app for getting around Seattle on Metro for years. Latest update (2.1.4) will not run at all for me though. App hangs as soon as it is opened to the map page and displays the error, "OneBusAway has stopped." Cleared cache, uninstalled/reinstalled, rebooted phone. Running on OnePlus One running CynaogenOS (official) v.13.1.2-ZNH2Ka3PO-bacon). Just posting here to notify, will revise rating as soon as there's a fix. Thanks! Update: excellent support from OneBus, changing themes from Hexo resolves this issue.

	   Every app can make mistakes most of the people who negatively comment on this app didn't use logic to know that a 20-minute delay could not be accurate

	<title>Used to work before yay material design</title>
	<comment>
	   Was good and to the point. With the material design update, it's become totally useless. Stops aren't saved. Saved stops are mixed up. Some of the buses on the route don't show up. I have to re list all my saved stops every time they update the app. Whoever decided this upgrade should be fired.

	<title>Somewhat accurate.</title>
	<comment>
	   About 60% of the time its fairly accurate. The other 40% the bus time will either dissapear and start showing the next bus time, or it will start saying the bus already left -3 minites ago, yet the bus hasnt come yet. The gps tracking system is completely unreliable and has never once been accurate for me.. I used to live in utah and used the UTA tracking app where you can watch the busses drive past you in real time in their app. Maybe take a tip from them.

	<comment>
	   Fits the needs of most transiters. Note:it is not for the light bus user, and it is not for making plans. Use a trip planner for that. This is for finalizing your routine commute, etc. Use it for what it is meant for, and it works really well! My suggestion is to make it more apparent as to whether the app is being slow, or if the bus system is just not giving the app good info. Sometimes it can be ambiguous.

	   Told me that a bus was running two minutes late and was due in ten minutes. Two minutes later I watch my bus drive by. The app then informs me that I have 35 minutes to wait. Because of the faulty information on this app, I have had more than one bus drive by me. Don't count on this app!

	<comment>
	   It says three service alerts on every bus route but there are none and it takes up half the screen. Inaccurate 89% of the time. It tells only what time the bus is set to arrive by schedule, not the actual ETA. Maybe you guys should talk to our local agency if it's their fault. It was cleaner, less cluttered and easier/quicker to navigate before the summer update.

	   Takes a little getting used to, in terms of knowing what to click to access what info... But part of this is a function of same routes going different directions and stops with multiple bays. The reminder alarm is awesome. However, maybe call it an alert as a reminder makes you think it's tied to schedule rather than real-time location data.

	   Although the functionality of OBA has always been fantastic, I spent years in jealousy of iOS and how much better their version of the app looked. Well, finally the tables have turned and the Android app far surpasses iOS (in my opinion). With this visual overhaul, I felt compelled to share how great this is. Looks great, works perfectly, and is an absolute must have for anyone using public transport in Seattle. Great work guys!

	   Trying to figure out the best bus route before leaving for work/school can be pretty difficult, but this app makes it so much easier. I really like the "plan a trip" feature. I would like if they added some kind of alert that would tell you when your stop is coming up, but other than that I can't think of anything that could be changed. Overall, a great app!

Now for TL;DR: Every schedule, route, and stop for every King County Metro or Sound Transit vehicle in my pocket. Realtime info on how off-schedule those vehicles are, based on radioed odometer data. All of the above integrated seamlessly with a handy map of the service area. Regular updates, mostly for the hard, thankless task of fixing bugs. It doesn't get better than this, folks.

	  I love the app since I take the bus to work. But this last update has caused a problem with my list of starred stops. The screen only shows the top edge of each line, so I can't read the stop name. I have to click on each and see the actual times in order to see the stop name. Update: sent you a screenshot Update: Developer responded, and the next time they updated the app, my problem was also fixed. I really love this!

	   Each update makes the UI prettier but makes the app slower and harder to use. Speed of use should be the apps number one concern.

	  This app, in no way shape or form gives you real bus time.... It can say you have a 35 min wait..and a bus will come 11 mins later ... Or vice versa... Making it extreamly hard to plan trips. Also no matter how many times I try I can NEVER report a problem.It will always instruct me to "try again later because of an error." hit or miss...

	   Times are inaccurate as all hell, caused me a LOT grief by referring to these times. Often nowadays, a bus will be very late (as usual) but the app will list the bus as having arrived, which freaks me out and causes me to question my sanity. I can't tell what's really so awful here, Seattle's buses or this app.

	   I'm a daily bus rider several routes and stops all day, and with this app I have all my stops listed with one tap of a widget! It's so easy! And the info is super accurate 90% of the time...EXCELLENT APP, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!UPDATE: 2 yrs later...still loving it. Won't ever be without this app on any device. July 2016: You people leaving bad reviews need to realize this app gets its info from YOUR LOCAL TRANSIT SYSTEM, so if times are wrong, blame THEM not One Bus Away.

	   Omigod! I don't know what's up with this new update but it is wrong a LOT! It says the bus is late and then at the last second it says it's early and then it says it hasn't left yet but the bus is long gone. So irritating. Today I caught four different buses and every one of them had the time wrong. I'm better off using the time schedules and going out early. Crap on a cracker.

	   It was wonderful before the updates but the layout of the bus times is absolutely terrible. Before, it would show the busses in order by the time, of course. However, now it only shows random busses and you have to click, scroll, and find the right one since they aren't all represented. Is there a way to Uninstall the updates so I can use the old version?

	  "Upgrade" makes it horrible now. Favorites are gone replaced by recent stops / recent routes. Currently defaults to recent routes when I need recent stops and there is no way to change defaults. New text is hard to read, colors are all wrong. This app didn't need to be tampered with. Now looking for a better app to replace this one.

	<comment>
	   The app use to work fine, but now with the new update, the app can't find my location, and the screen doesn't even move to your location like it use to. Please fix this app or let people reinstall the older version of this app.

	<title>Not real time</title>
	<comment>
	   Times are innacurate, when you tap on a stop it will show you all the busses from 5 hrs ago and you have to scroll down to look for the right one, and even when you find it, it's not real time. I no longer use this app because it has caused me to miss busses. Using the GOMTS messaging option is much more accurate.

	<comment>
	   New ui is clunky, adds unnecessary busyness to the user experience and there was nothing wrong with the old UI to begin with! In addition, the new version is actually less accurate, only showing me the scheduled times rather than what the bus is actually running about 80% of the time. I mostly used the app to see if my buses were on schedule so now it's practically useless.

	   Why must every app downgrade in appearance as if designed by "let's make the ugliest looking app contest." The choice in color theme, fonts, icons, placement are all wrong. Do you even get outside opinions or is it a what we think is what everyone must accept attitude?

	   Kicks in the teeth of all other transit apps. Only thing I'd change is the icon, devs if you're listening a single train on its own would be fantastic, no border, e.g. just the train on the right from the current icon.

	   Really like the old version and was easier to use. The new update continues to say I am out of range even when I have location set on. It keeps thinking I am in the middle of Africa and have answer dialogue box each time I got into app even though my region is set in app. Please fix. Also there is so many more screens to click through to get to a screen that use to take one or two clicks.

	   Nice new look - a lot easier to use! Makes bus travel a LOT easier. HARTLine service in my area is spotty and traffic is horrendous here in Tampa and this app lets me walk out into the heat right when the bus is coming regardless of bus delays. With the exception of one crummy tablet I no longer have, runs great on all my devices.

	   Its SOO buggy and by that I mean I can open the app without it closing immediately, so I can't get the info I need. Also the app is extra complicated too use, every time I try too look at a bus route it closes that screen and moves too my current location. I DON'T CARE about my location, thats why I'm leaving there in the first place!!!!!!!!

	   So often, UI redesigns result in a slick new look, but under the covers the functionality is buggy and degraded. Not this one. EXCELLENT feature set and presentation. Devs obviously put allot of thought, time, and iterations into this update. Thanks for not rushing this out before ready as so often happens. Very well done.

	   Most recent changes made it so very pretty, and user unfriendly. Once took one presd to see a bus list, now, many. Routes at a stop are a star instead of a filter, and is now two and three steps and very slow Someone failed user ease class, never go ten clicks when two will do. Switching to the competition, which are now catching up and number.

	   I do not turn on the location on my phone. It eats my battery and I don't like the idea of my phone advertising my location all the time. Without location on, this app seems to think I'm in the middle of Africa. It also seems to glitch out and lose my spot every time I open it and while I'm actively using it. How come this app's settings don't allow me to enter my zip code? I think that would be a simple and common sense solution for users.

	<comment>
	   The app (onebusaway) has said that four busses (rt. 120) have come and gone from this stop (stop 36300) since I have been standing here. No busses have come. Either there is a glitch in the app and a mistake in the written schedule, or someone is juking the stats. Finally, after 20 min a bus that was not a phantom bus arrived.

	   In my home area, sometimes buses are shown to have left when they actually have not arrived. That error can be as much as 30 minutes. Not sure if this problem can be fixed or is limited by the available technology.

	   I don't like how when you go back to the map it automatically takes you back to your location instead of where you were looking at a stop. Can.be..frustrating when you're trying to.see what time another bus comes.

	  Remember those things called Blackberries? The corporate world is full of them. EEN the new phones that are Android compatible are not enjoying onebusaway. Please work on this. With the newer models of Blackberry phones all being android compatible, they are going to used more. We still use metro. Please address issues. My BlackBerry Classic crashes every time I touch a stop icon. It also has issues locating me.

	   On many occasions busses have not shown up at the times listed. This has occurred at many bus stop all across Tampa. I am also unable to send error reports. I, ironically, receive error messages when trying to report errors. I am running this app on a OnePlus One phone running Oxygen OS 1.0.

	   Downloaded latest version hoping for improved realtime tracking. Not surprisingly it hasn't improved. Still primarily good for finding bus stops and schedules. Uninstalling, again. Previous review: Not showing real time tracking for Seattle buses. Help files non-existent. Good if you only want to see the default bus schedule, something you can get from metro.

	   It works O.K., but regularly has bus times that are incorrect, or busses that are given estimated times constantly change or never show up (my girlfriend and I call these ghost busses). Could be a product of seattles terrible transportation system but either way i regularly miss busses or wait much longer because the app is flat out wrong.

	<title>Passing but inherently flawed.</title>
	<comment>
	   Growing steadily unusable and inaccurate as the months go by, this suffers from a growing number of issues. The late or early times are consistently wrong and therefore useless, not to mention duplicated old schedule readings from at the same stop. Buses are cleared when the app deems them as arrived which is not the case literally half the time, preventing people from effectively checking whether they could even still make the bus. Google maps is more effective at routing without even trying.

	  I've used the iOS version on my iPod for years, and it has been vital for me. Not having access without wi-fi, I can't speak to how accurate arrivals have been, but it was useful for telling me when to leave the house and how to plan my trips. Today I finally got a smartphone and I am really confused by how different the Android version is. The apple version has tabs listing recent and bookmarked stops. The latter has been ESSENTIAL for being able to look at connecting buses when I have a route with transfers. But this version only gives me a map. I have to search for the next stop every time, and if I'm still far away, or don't remember the exact street... what a hassle. Not to mention that I can't easily switch between two stops (because sometimes I have a choice about which bus to take depending on which will arrive sooner between stops that are only a block apart.) And I notice that the view for the stops have a star I can add at the top, so there SEEMS to still be favourites, but how can I view them? I really need those tabs back and then I can put the stars back on this review.

	<title>Maybe it ought to track Metro Buses in real time, especially the route I am waiting on, & not just appointed times. This way time management welcome!</title>

	   Just a needlessly detached cache of maps. I need this app to be in realtime. Otherwise it's better than nothing. Barley.

	<comment>
	   Realize times come from MARTA, their GPS is terribly inaccurate. Too many ghost buses. Unable to report to you, to report to them as your " report a problem tab" does not connect and apparently neither does your email link in the app.

	    is barely better than just checking the bus schedule yourself and sometimes worse because it will swing wildly from "delayed by 23 minutes" to "arriving five minutes early" and various times in between. And then you get to the stop and find out that you should have just never checked  because your "delayed" bus was pretty much on time and you missed it.

	   It works alright but the tracking of the buses are not up to date half the time. The times are off anywhere from two minutes to twelve minutes. It needs to be corrected soon.

	   It straight up will lie to you. Multiple times in the past week I've been waiting for my bus and it kept getting delayed until finally it just dissappears from the list 45 min later. The bus never comes but it says it did. It's bullshit, you can't trust it.

	   Used to be a life saver, getting me to and from work on time. For the past week it says my bus is on time, and I watch it pass my stop 6/7 minutes early. Doesn't update when a bus is early, making it a guessing game . Extremely disappointed.

	<comment>
	   This app used to be stellar and very helpful for my commute. It seems OBA rested on their laurels and stopped caring about accurate information and their users. The times are incorrect 90% of the time and never reflect delays accurately. Even despite reporting errors through the app, it sends nothing has changed. Look at their customer service! They send the same generic prompt to most 1 star reviews listed here! Don't waste your time with this app, you'll only be frustrated with it.

	   This app transmits your current location to its server over an unencrypted connection. This is a privacy risk. I hope that the developers will correct that. Otherwise, it's a very useful tool.

	<comment>
	   Up until one minute ago, it said that the 28 was going to be 36 minutes late. Now, one minute before the scheduled arrival, it changes to 7 minutes late. This is the usual pattern for all busses at all stops: the ETA is wildly wrong until a couple of minutes before scheduled time. How about when you finally give a reasonable ETA for one stop, you use that to update the rest of the stops on the same route? I tried to submit this through "report a problem", but apparently that doesn't work either.

	   I transferred to a school in Tampa, and never rode public transportation before. It was a hassle trying to understand when the bus came and where, just by looking at the maps posted online, until I seen an ad for this app. I tell all my commuter friends about it! 馃檶 Don't expect the times to be 100% prefect, if that bus is coming early, it's coming EARLY!

	   It gives the option to report problems but it never allows you to send the report. Also, on rainy and overcast days dose not displays the right times for the bus. This poor app added to the poor bus service in Tampa makes for a really bad user experience.

	  Have missed many meetings and been late due to "ghost buses" in this app. The app shows a bus coming in 10 minutes, I wait and wait. It shows it arriving, I wait and wait. It shows it having left the stop already. There was no effing bus. Maybe it's bad data from the city buses, but the OneBusAway devs really need to find a different way of addressing that. It is essentially a crapshoot whether there's a bus or not. Uninstalled.

	   I thought this app would have a feature where you could enter your address/ destination & be able to see the buses that make stops nearby but it doesn't have such a feature which is HIGHLY disappointing! It makes it very frustrating to use because it asks you for a stop # which Im sure few actually know, I had to access Google Transit to get it. Also it Wont let you report a problem with the trip says its unable to do so

	   When I moved to Seattle years ago, this was great. However, for the last few weeks, there have been a lot of incorrect bus departure times posted for the 50 bus. Not sure about other routes since lately I really only use this route. Example: departures every 30 minutes on Sundays, when it's really once an hour. Every 15 minutes or so on weekdays when is really every 30 minutes. Update: after looking at other stops, it appears that you're displaying arrival and departure times at the route end/beginning...

	   Bug: in the Starred Stops shortcut, when you search for a route, the search bar completely overlaps the first result. Feature request: let users create categories for starred stops, such as "To Home" and "To Work". The 6 starred stops i have inexplicably rearrange themselves so it would be great to allow users to group stops together.

	  Was very reliable helped wounders, I work nights and would wait til very last min to leave my home to catch the bus. Now it's not telling if it's on time or delayed, I'm very irritated by this......NOW!!! I wait almost 10 min because this bus is always late but I don't wanna take a chance and miss it. My job docs pay..

	   This app works wonders to find bus times in between the main stops of the routes which can be tricky to figure out otherwise. Even if you just need a general idea of when the next few busses come this app is fast and can do a lot. The map and gps functions are really nice too

	   I love this app. It's not 100%, but it's unrealistic to expect it to be. They make big improvements too: My bus schedule changes depending on if the university is in operation and it used to still show the buses not on the schedule with a scheduled arrival. One Bus Away worked with the transit system and they fixed it so those buses don't show up. It's almost ridiculous how much I rely on this app, it's awesome.

	<comment>
	   I'm not sure if it is the app, where it pulls data from, or just my city's bus system (Seattle), but this app used to be pretty darn accurate with bus arrivals. But the last 2 or 3 updates the accuracy has gotten worse and worse....now I'm missing busses almost daily as they show up 5 min before or after the app says, or don't show at all and THEN the app reconciles. It's a bit useless now that it's so far off. :/

	   It's nice when it's right, but that's not very often. Most of the time, it's way off. I'm currently waiting for a bus that was 10 minutes early, but the app still said it was on it's way. I've been sitting at this bus stop for nearly an hour waiting for a bus that's supposed to run every half hour. And it's gone by the other way 3 times since I got here.

	   Guess I'm lucky enough for my routes being shown as pretty accurate. I've seen some busses being way off as I wait at my bus stop and compare them to the app, but I've never had too much of a problem yet. For someone who has to transfer pretty often, I love the feature to clearly see all of a station's arrivals/departures.

	  this app was only good when I first started using it like 5 years ago. I started using it again in the last year and the bus never comes as predicted. the only time the bus comes as predicted is when it actually comes on time. I don't know why I rely on this app and should just get to the bus stop 5 minutes early regardless of what this app says. Tried to send a report and of course got an error, so here's my rating.

	<comment>
	   The UI is rather anti-intuitive at times, but the real problem is that this app is extremely unreliable. On average it is about 3-4 minutes off, either early or later than actual time, but not consistently off so you can't adjust. Sometimes it says a bus will be 20 minutes late, but it leaves 5 minutes early. Sometimes it says it will leave on time, but the bus is 15 minutes late. You can't even ballpark a general time. The app is right so infrequently that it's useless.

	   I keeping looking for a better transit app but always keep coming back to OneBusAway for transit times as a daily bus rider. Times are accurate to within a minute. This app is no frills. Wouldn't mind having an Android Wear companion app but that would just be a bonus. Love the reminders feature. Good work!

	<title>Inaccurate updates. Poor design. Why even bother?</title>
	<comment>
	   The real-time updating of route arrivals at bus stops is terrible. Many times I have checked the arrival status of the route I'm waiting for and the app will show I have 5 minutes until the bus gets to me. 5 minutes go by, no bus. I check the arrival status again and the app shows the next arrival time is 20 minutes from now. So what happened to the bus that was 5 minutes away? I simply plan on being 15 minutes early at my stop and I will be uninstalling this app from my phone.

	   This app used to be amazing I depended on it to ensure I could get home in time after work to care for my infant. Since the recent update nothing sync up. It doesn't say if my bus is early, or late it always says on time which is literally never the case. Way to mess up a good thing

	   Buses in Tampa in some areas of town run more often than other parts of Hillsborough Co. Not sure where a bus stop is one bus can get ur location and get u directions to a stop. Its just about as close to being accurate as is anything being free!

	   Update... timing is always off too....I use this app often and find that some of the stops listed for common routes are inaccurate. If you know the route its ok. If not double check with the transit company website. I'm also disappointed with the problem reporting. I tried to email them about the erroneous stop and got an auto reply saying the email was not monitored and to email another address. Really? Frustrating...

	  It seems to give only an estimated arrival time for this whole bus system. This is useless to me, worse, detrimental. I missed a ferry b/c of this & running 2 hours behind. Went directly to the community transit website & that info is updated in real time. Please let me know if you can update your program. I'm planning on uninstalling it w/ great anger.

	   The app is really reliable bus time and route wise but the UI is horrible and the fact that u can only go by routes and stops is ridiculous because most of my stops dont show the route number on them and i dont know the routes im taking because im foreign to here. This app should really look at what pittsburgh PAT track is doing and take from that cus right now it isnt helpful at all really.

	   The timing system in this app is very rarely correct- in fact, it seems like it only chooses to be correct when being correct would personally inconvenience you. This tends to be extremely frustrating when you're forced into a situation where you only get to the stop a couple minutes before it's supposed to get there, and it turns out that the bus was very early despite supposedly being on time etc etc. There are probably more accurate apps out there.

	<comment>
	   You are being reported to Metro King County for reporting inaccurate time. I relied on your app for accurate time and no more. Because of the app hacker error I missed my Bus ruining my transfer to another bus. You reported schedule was delayed by 39 minutes on multiple times. Because of that I had to find delay time. All of a sudden bus appeared and I missed it. Because of your immature tech people playing games it is going to take me 2 hours to get home. Thank you I am reporting this to 4000 colleagues!

	<comment>
	   I have used this app for almost a year. Today when I opened it, an alert came up saying that I was out of range, the Tampa area, and would I like to go there? All of my favorite routes and stops are gone. What the hel happened??? Edit: I discovered that I could use OneBusAway online in my browser. Thank the gods! Reply: Region was set to "Automatic". It began working again after about a week. I had already uninstalled/reinstalled/updated the app. It is working properly now.

	   This app has proven invaluable to someone like me who frequently rides the bus. Not right away user friendly but once u get the hang of it...golden! Plus I love how its multi-county so I can easily and seamlessly go from king county transit to pierce county transit and back again. Truly amazing app!

	<comment>
	   While getting accurate times for the buses can be helpful, I don't see how this app is useful for anything else at all. You can't see multiple routes at once, can't plan a trip, doesn't figure out routes... unless you already know the trip and map/area very well, this is almost totally useless in comparison with google maps. I certainly don't want to have to use two apps for one purpose, seems dumb

	<comment>
	   Simply because the people driving the busses report incorrect times, they do not stop at the corect spots, they do not even keep to their own schedules. If the bus was a restaurant I'd never come back, because now the report button for bad drivers amd incorrect times doesn't even work anymore. The only point left in this app is that it saves paper, the only convenience being its easy to see buses on this. Terrible customer service in real life, make the app better by starting with your employees!

	<comment>
	   This simple app has become a part of my weekday commute ritual! Every day when I leave my apartment or the office I open the app and use the favorite stops/routes feature to check when the bus will be there. The data is *usually* really accurate, and when it isn't I'm betting that it's the city bus system's issue and not the app. UI could be slightly more efficient to use for people who take the same route/stop every day - this is why I'm rating it four stars instead of five. Highly recommended!

	   Heard about this from a Taxi driver. Tried it out and the bus avrives down to the minute listed on the app. Easy to use, just type the code printed at the top of the bus post and hit go, and soon you will be able to plan your day much more accurately.

	<comment>
	   A very useful app, but it doesnt seem to have route-specific schedules (that allows you to see when your bus will arrive at various stops along its route) like the iOS version does. That was my favorite and most-used feature of this app; I'm a little disappointed that the Android version doesn't seem to have it.

	<comment>
	   The time it says that the bus will arrive is never right. Would say it's 18 minutes early one minute then would say it's on time the next or would say 3 minutes late then say 2 minutes early. This app is garbage and isn't reliable at all. Probably cause seattle just sucks at things.

	   I use this everyday, but when the buses are in the downtown Seattle core, the app will be frequently off by many minutes. Many times I will be standing there looking at the app when it is saying a bus has arrived or is just leaving and clearly the bus never showed up. Happens maybe once or twice a week. Catching buses on the eastside the app is usually dead on.

	<comment>
	   Real time tracking (which has previously been 5-star accurate) has not yet returned to normal since it went on holiday-standby mode during Metro's Reduced Service over the Xmas "break." (**And, hey Metro! Just because the kiddos are out of school, doesn't mean most of we working stiffs aren't still needing to ride to work everyday! Right?) Adding up to an hour per day of unplanned bus stop waiting over the course of my daily 30 mile commute. Bring back ol' reliable for +2 stars.

	<title>Why so difficult & different?</title>
	<comment>
	   I switched from iPhone to the android but now I'm not sure because the onebusaway app is very different compared to the iPhone. I can't even edit the name of the bus stop I want to keep or have a bookmark place for my stops for me to go back to like the iPhone. I want to keep this android phone, but u need to fix this app to b user friendly like the iPhone. Why is the onebusaway app so different from the iPhone? Isn't the app from the same creators??

	   It's a great app that lets you know where the buses are that are near your stop in real time and when others will be near you.

	   this app always works for me.. being bus my primary transport, it helps me to plan my trips by showing exact bus arrival times.. Nice idea. it would be more helpful if I get info about derouting of buses. sometimes bus takes different road and it never comes on stop.

	<comment>
	   This app is indispensable if you use Metro! The annoying "Would you like to enable location services?" pop-up seems to have been removed, which was probably the only thing that prevented me from giving a five star rating. Also like other people said it's not exactly accurate on holidays, but that's probably not the app's fault.

	<comment>
	   So when fix maybe it works fine,but now asking for new update & I can't yet. First update it was saying all buses 1he or more or 80-188 minutes etc All incorrect,but I went by the minutes and not telling me when they are late lately either. I am late for appt & now #32 MLK & Highland 27 minutes late. Is only like 5 or so minutes till next bus,so it makes no sense when is hot or cold out that they are late. I hope I make 7 downtown at corner of MLK & Armenia out from WTC so can get to my appt@ Tampa Bay Blv

	   Never accurate. The times shown are almost always 5-10 minutes off and I've missed buses due to its inaccurate times. I only use it for a lack of alternatives. Also, I've never received any customer service or helpful responses to my inquiries which makes the whole experience - commuting, bussing, traveling, etc., just that much more frustrating.

	   Already had my route planned out but if you're unfamiliar with the area this can be really confusing. I'm still trying to decode the color pattern of the numbers in the far right. Also trying to figure out why a bus would depart 23 mins early. King County website and Google are better options for newbies

	   You just have to know how to manage the app although it seems like its perfect its not. I notice a couple of bugs in it is far as accuracy. when I leave on time the bus will still sometimes beat me to the bus stop, Yes - while following the time on the app! in other words the time skips a few seconds or whatnot. Other times it's a lifesaver. So it's so so

	<comment>
	   Need information for detours and their new stops. Also if there could be an option about the number of reminders under preferences, that would be great. I usually put my reminders 10 mins before the bus is about to arrive (which is great) but I get reminders almost every minute or two for those 10 mins and a couple more after, which frankly gets very annoying. Other than that, pretty good about telling me if there are delays.

	   This app used to be spot on, but I can't trust it at all anymore. Seems like a part of the metro budget cuts. It's a shame because this app was such an amazing resource for public transit for the last two years that I've lived here. Now google maps seems to be more accurate, and they were never as dependable as One Bus Away.

	   This is probably the best thing invited since sliced bread. I will no longer just guess when the bus is coming. And its always on point. The gps might be a bit off but other than that, this is the most useful app i have on my phone.

	   Sometimes this app works great... Other times its garbage.... Often it will say your bus is going to show up on time, then at the last second it updates to say its 10+ minutes delayed.... If it truly has a 10 minute delay its obvious it doesn't develop this in half a second... Iron out the kinks already....

	   Frequently off by 10+ minutes. Sometimes the bus never comes or has already left when the app says it's 5 minutes away. Better off using the official schedule and praying for a bus to show up.

	   The arrival times are very inaccurate. "Departed 9 minutes early" refresh 5 minutes later, and it says "Now!" And that's every day. Also the auto gps is annoying. If I need to look at bus stops that I'm headed to I always to have scroll my way over to them each time I launch the page.

	   needs to be upgraded constantly displaying wrong times saying its super late but comes on time. also an option to pick if its a weekend or weekday because its labor day but displays it as if its a weekday when in fact metro runs on holiday schedule. also the GPS is wonky as hell.

	   Used to be spot on. Now it's 3-5 minutes off, which, with connection buses in the Puget Sound, is pretty bad. Also, doesn't take into account holidays.

	   If you understand that sometimes the arrival times are wrong simply because of garbage-in-garbage out, this is usually a helpful ESTIMATE of your bus' arrival time. A few bug fixes lately, but they're not fixing reported and obvious route errors.

	   So I like this app after I found out how to use it. The stops didn't make sense... so when I found out the bus time, it was for the bus coming opposite me. I thought I'd clicked on the right stop but I guess not. Then I saw the little arrows. They saved my life! Make the arrows a more visible color and this app would be perfect.

	   It takes forever to find my location at times. And sometimes when it finally decides to try and locate me, it gets me in a totally different location! I try and make it relocate but it's stubborn and keeps saying im at the same point. It's a good app when it ACTUALLY WORKS.

	   This used to be pretty good, but it doesn't work anymore. Every time I've used it lately, it gives me totally wrong info. E.g., buses that "arrive" and "depart" without ever appearing at the stop.

	   This app is so unreliable that it has become effectively useless. The times are meaningless anymore as they are always inaccurate, which defeats the purpose of even checking it. So if you're using OneBusAway, just know that you're probably going to be late.

	   After some overnight experimentation, I've discovered OneBusAway drains my (idle) battery life three times faster than when the app isn't installed (30% drain overnight vs 10% when the app isn't installed). Going to try Transit instead.

	<title>The only way I catch my buses now!</title>
	<comment>
	   Overall, this is a great app. My curry recently did trait service cuts, and the buses are now often running late or at different times, and this app is great for figuring out where the hell my bus is! The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because there's some functionality I miss from the iOS version -- particularly, seeing the times a given route will be at other stops without having to look for those stops and make a guess

	   This app was so helpful for me when I moved here from out of state. I had never used a public bus system before so this was a life saver app for me. There are others out there but this is what most of the locals use. Love the favorites feature for my common stops.

	  Edit: actual practicality of this app is minimal, due to latency between gps fetching and actual bus time arrivals. Even when buses are late (or on time) bus drivers often compensate to reach the destination at the prescribed time. Thus it would be no different if not more safe with the actual timetable of the route than this app (that is, if you try and get to a bus stop even almost "exactly" on time, you will miss many a bus!)

	   I went downtown via the 41. After I got downtown, did some shopping, I wanted to head home. The bus schedule was supposed to be set for holidays, but it wasn't. OBA was giving me a workweek schedule when the system was operating on a Sunday schedule. Not cool.

	<comment>
	   Gave it a shot, but its departure times were straight up wrong. Watched a bus go by that it said wasn't due for 15 minutes; another bus that was supposed to be there came 10 minutes later. Compared it against the published times (it just uses scheduled times, not actual times) and saw it had the wrong info. Pretty basic fail.

	   Gotta say, this is a great app. I actually find myself using this more than the official Marta app. I can only think of two things that would make it just about perfect, & one thing that would be nice. 1: Have the time color meanings in the app itself, at the bottom or maybe via a quick view button/switch so as not too leave the schedule you're viewing. 2: Have a "satellite" view option on the map. Lastly something I know you might not be able to do is have a bus icon on the map that moves in real-time. That plus the "satellite" view would be really cool.

	<comment>
	   This app is only half as good as the "same" app on iPhone. Moving from iPhone to Android, I was delighted to see OBA was on Android. The thing I loved about the app was if I know a bus time 2 hours from now, I could look at the table information and get the bus number (the actual bus, not the route number) and if it changes to another route after it is finished with the run it is currently on. The android app does not do this. For me, it's important information. Please put it in!!

	  This app is great for all those times you're sitting at the bus stop wondering when that bus will finally get here. The alarm feature also lets me wait until the last minute to go to the bus stop, and helps remind me to watch out for my stop on long bus rides. I've only noticed problems with accuracy during severe weather.

	<comment>
	   I love this app and use it daily. The times are extremely accurate - moreso than the schedule times! A few suggestions: Right now I have to use Google Maps to figure out which bus to take, where to get on and off, and then this app to see when to catch it. I would like to be able to do it all in this app. I also wish the UI was better - like the iOS version. It's an ugly app. I don't like the reminders beeping every minute, even after you dismiss the notification. It's annoying and unnecessary.

	   I was use to the buses never arriving as shown, but now they do not acknowledge my bus stop exists. More than 5 bus routes stop daily and I get on one so I am pretty sure it exists. 1-5 south or north bound Mountlake terrace. Just north of Seattle Washington.

	<title>Still crashes phone fairly frequently</title>
	<comment>
	   I wrote a review a while back in September that I accidentally deleted when I went to update it today (January). This app, while useful, still has the very annoying feature that it often crashes my phone when I click the back button on the 'list of coming buses' page for a given bus stop. It restarts the entire phone, so there is no opportunity to submit a bug report. None of the app updates have fixed this issue, at least not permanently. While the crashes are ultimately just an inconvenience, if Google ever implements decent real-time bus tracking in Google Maps for Seattle, I don't think I would keep using this app.

	   Feature request. Do a social networking part and allow us to report when we actually get picked up to get stats on how often a bus is on time. Allow users to comment on bus times and routes.

	   This is missing times on the 555 bus. I have already submitted a bug but I have not heard back from them. Also a better widget would be very useful.

	<comment>
	   This app is great for king county metro, occasionally off by a minute or three, but very close, especially overall. However, it seems that community transit and sound transit are both not integrated, so you only see the scheduled times, not updated estimates. Really hoping for that as most of my current riding is the latter two!

	   I've been using this app in the Seattle Redmond area for 7 months. In 2013 it was great. Since the new year it is off most of the time. Forget about using this app on holidays, not even close to reality. Looking for new app.

	<comment>
	   This app was not updated for holiday times, specifically New Years Day for us. That affected more than you know in our lives, including miscommunication among people and an elderly disabled woman picking someone up because no more on time buses were thought to come. And I tried to send as report but it said error and wouldn't send. So now I'm posting for all to see. So much for relying on lame apps like this one!

	<comment>
	   I'm not getting real-time bus information. I can be at a stop and watch it go from saying the bus will be there in 4 minutes, to 2, to NOW, to -2, while no bus comes. I realize that "your bus will be there in 4 minutes" is partly a guess, because traffic and other things happen, but "the bus is at your stop now" and "it left 2 minutes ago" are factual statements that are either true or false.

	<comment>
	   I use this app all the time and I really don't know what I would do without it. It usually loads quickly and is pretty accurate. However, on snow days where bus schedules are changed or cancelled, the app still shows a bus as on the way or passed. This app would be amazing if it took this into account instead of fooling you into thinking a bus is going to stop at a stop that has in fact been cancelled for whatever reason.

I see a lot of people complaining about the look of this vs ios I just switched from iPhone to android on Monday and I think it looks great. Maybe it looks different on the note 3 than other phones...

	<comment>
	   Can't view the route on a map? One you have the route selected, can't access expected arrival times for each stop? I'm sure I'll only continue to find more limitations with this app as I continue to use it since I've only had the app for a couple hours after switching to android from iPhone yesterday. But this app is still better than the awful metro website.

	   Metro couldn't've done it better themselves (but that's not saying much based on THEIR site) but why such an ugly UI? iPhone version is 20 times cleaner and polished.

	<comment>
	   I would have given this app a solid 5 stars a few weeks ago. Now, however, even after updating, it is regularly unable to find my location, unable to locate stops... and when it does, it is wildly inaccurate. Lots of "ghost buses" or ridiculous arrival times (300 minutes to next bus!), and often it is miles away from my actual location when it finally "finds" me. I still gave it 3 stars because, despite these problems, it is still indespensible (and free).

	   I went out of town and the app wanted to put me in Atlanta when I got back. It kept sending the message about "trying to get a fix on your location". The solution was to click on Menu and select Preferences. I unchecked the Automatic Region option and manually selected my region. It's working now again.

	   This app works like a charm. It's saved me lots of time particularly when the bus is late, or gets me hurrying when the bus is even early! Only reliability issue is that when routes change I don't think these guys are the first to hear about it, but they still change it pretty fast.

	   Accurate and reliable! Love it! Takes awhile to figure out how to navigate this app, save your routes/stops, etc. Could be less cumbersome. But otherwise great.

	   Being able to tell whee busses are, when they'll arrive, and when they will reach your destination does loads for making connections, shopping trips, and knowing how long you have in between connections for other diversions!

	   The learning curve for using this app is quite steep. If you already know your bus routes it makes things a lot easier. But using it with a new bus is so complicated.

	   This app works great for weekdays, and would earn 4 stars for that. However, minus 2 stars for not working on weekends or holidays. It is completely inaccurate and still runs the weekday schedules for the busses.

	   I just moved to Seattle and find myself using this app a lot so I know when to leave the office. The tracking for the bus arrivals/departures is great. The app itself is slow and old. It would be great if we could get a nice holo update.

	   The only thing that could make this app any better is if I could save it to my SD card. Otherwise, Love this app and it's new to Tampa but now that I have it I will most likely use it many times a day and now I can save money on the schedule books they try to sell every 3-4 months!!! (Update: I still love this app but it would be nice if you could see not only a GPS for you but a GPS for the bus your waiting on to see where the bus is on the map in real time!!!) Add that and save to SD easy 5 Stars!!!

	   My only complaint is there is some math needed if you catch a bus at the beginning of a route. I often catch the 41 in Lake City and often it will say bus is due in 15 mins/12 min delay. 15 - 12 = sure enough bus arrives 3 mins later. Aside from that, great app for us transit riders! :)

	   I use this daily, for simple trips and to help decide which connection to hop based on wait times. You can also hop a bus that's kind of unfamiliar and quickly use OBA to find out it's route on a map or as a list of stops. The week my phone was broken, this is the *only* app I missed!

	<comment>
	   This app just saved me at least 15min waiting in the sun, which I'll partially return by rating it. In 2011, I was not a fan. Now I am. The realtime scheduling is much better/faster updating. Today, when the app told me that I had 4 minutes and that the bus was ahead of schedule, I knew that I really did only have 4 minutes and should run. If I memorized the schedule (why?!?) I wouldn't be in the AC with my feet up. Other features like favorites and maps are also improved and helpful. Right Times? #win

	   The app is okay but it tells you your bus is delayed when it's not and you end missing your bus. I ignore what the app says for delays and just look at when it's scheduled to arrive.

	   This is a very good app. I've used it a lot to get around Redmond and Seattle. Easy to use UX and accurate times. I do wish however that the app cached the recent data so that I didn't have to find the stop again whenever I reopened the app.

	   I've used this app for more than a year and half the time, the bus times are wrong. It's use another app if I could but there isn't an alternative.

	<comment>
	   Use to be great. It Use to show actual arrival time and how many minutes the bus was late or early. Now it just shows scheduled arrival time. Which is pretty useless. Because buses are never on time. I don't need an app for this I could just get the booklet or download the scheduled arrival time.

	   Seemed to work fairly well when I first installed it. Since, I have seen many imaginary buses go by and many routes not listed at actual stops. Both problems continue to get worse.

	<comment>
	   I love this app. I live in Seattle and we have a fantastic public transportation system. This app reliably tells me not only how long until my bus arrives but also which other routes stop there and how far away they are, whether my bus is delayed, and lots of other useful info. I use it almost every day.

	<comment>
	   This app works most of the time but not often enough to rely on when it really counts. When I am in a rush, it is no help when it won't load stops. When I am at a busy stop the times for upcoming buses have nothing to do with reality. Great idea, bad execution.

	   The information that this app gives is only as good as the data received from the agencies. Therefore if community transit makes a mistake in the data you'll probably see that here. also real time data has not been made available to oba yet for ct and ct operated sound transit routes. Metro and pierce transit appear to be solid though.

	<comment>
	   You can use this to find out when the next bus will arrive at your stop, but you can't use it to find how how to get to a particular destination. You have to go to KC Metro web site to do that, and that site isn't mobile device friendly. So its a disgrace for a so-called high tech city like Seattle is supposed to be. Shame!

	   The app does work but predictions are not accurate. It often says I missed a bus when it hasn't arrived yet or that the bus is coming when it's already gone. But accuracy is no worse than other apps. It is useful for having the schedule. Recent versions don't crash anymore.

	<comment>
	   This app is essential in navigating Seattle's bus system. When Metro's geo-location system is working at top form, this app gives very accurate info for when and where your next bus is. If the app cannot access Metro's geo-location system it will show you only scheduled times, but this is not the fault of the app, and is actually better than just saying, "data not available", as earlier versions did. Constantly improving with each update and glitches are quickly fixed. This is my most used app.

	   It looks like it might be useful, but it really needs the ability to download data for use offline since most bus stops don't have WiFi (similar to how Google Maps can download regions of the map). Of course it wouldn't have real-time updates, but it could still show published routes and timetables.

	<comment>
	   The UI is clean and the app functions well. My main reason for not giving it 5 stars is the lack of a "main page". The favorite stops/routes is the right idea, howere I would prefer this to appear when I open up the app, rather than a map. Also, the favorites pages should be more accessible while using the app, like in the menu bar at the top. The app functions great for finding bus times for new stops, but does not function as well for commuters who will only want to reference one page.

	   I would like to give this application a 5-star rating, but the lack of holiday and express informant makes the application dependable on most dates. It is deep dependable that the times it isn't sneak up on you and leave you bitter. The app works. It's good. Or isn't great.

	<comment>
	   When I am on the map view of this app sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn't. It usually tends to find me and show the routes for all of 5 secs then grows blank. Needs to be fixed asap.

	   The buses by my house seem to only be on time when I'm running late and this app lets me know what time they will really get to my stop. Also super helpful for figuring out stops between the ones marked in the bus service guide.

	   There are only a few issues (as others have said, stop times are sometimes wrong, and the location feature can be iffy and annoying) and as someone who soends four hours bussing all around king county every day, this apl is a total timesaver. Gone are the days of waiting 45 minutes for a 358 to show and just up and pass me by! Keep up the awesome work, and thank you.

	   I've had this app for two years and it just gets worse every update. Now it's in the habit of telling me a bus is 15+ minutes delayed, then suddenly saying it came 10 min prior only a minute later. I've missed 5 busses this week because of it.

	   If you use public transit as your primary mode-of-transportation, get this app. Before you walk all the way to that next stop, check the one youre at to make sure another one isn't coming by for a while. It also helps for unique service days like holidays and rerouting.

	<title>Okay app most the time but be careful on holidays</title>
	<comment>
	   Been using this app for a couple weeks now and it usually works well for the buses I ride (245, 255, 545). But had a bad experience on Thanksgiving Day where it showed the standard weekday schedule, not the Sunday schedule which it was on because of the holiday. Even if this was just a one-off oversight, it significantly reduced my confidence in the app and from now on I'll double check the King County Metro timetables before heading out the door. The only other small complaint is the map automatically centers to your current location. This makes sense the first time you go to map view, but if you've panned and zoomed the map to another area to check out its stops, when you return to the map, it should be where you left it. Since it auto-centers, it makes it really frustrating to research stops/routes that you may not be near at that moment. To end on a positive note, I do like the ability to add shortcuts to my starred bus stops/routes to my home screen.

	<comment>
	   Starred stops and handy widgets give you fast, unobtrusive access to its awesome service. Has its flaws: doesn't provide routing search functionality and occasionally gives bad readings. At worst, the bad readings are pulling from the schedule, though--it will never give you LESS information than Google Maps or Seattle Metro. Use Google Maps to look up which route, then check the stop arrival time on OneBus.

	   Used to be accurate but since the last update, the rapid ride A line is not even displaying at all, and most of my routes no longer show the actual arrival time, rather the scheduled arrival time. This is useless, since busses like the 180 are nearly always between 5 and 25 minutes late.

	<comment>
	   Given the technologies of today, OBA is just about as good as it gets. Sometimes it may be off by a minute or two, but really, that's not a big deal. If you're trying to get to the bus stop with only one minute until the bus is supposed to arrive, you were cutting it pretty close anyway. OBA is generally a surprisingly accurate app that I rely on multiple times a day. Highly recommended.

	   The timetable for the 75 bus is constantly incorrect. It used to work just fine but now for some reason is off. Fix it!

	   This app is very different on the iphone. I wish it was like that for androids. But the purpose of the app: awesome. Hard to use the bus system without it!

	   There is no reason for this app to have itself start up when you start your phone! Let the user choose to start it up when they need it...and close it when they want to. Will install when it quits forcing itself on the phone.

	   Fast response from dev. Nice use of screen realestate when viewing routes. Clean ui. It'd be nice if you could choose which screen the app opens with.

	   Perhaps one of these days, you guys could add a trip plannner so I can type my destination and it'll give me what buses I could take. Like how google maps work.

	<title>Bus route information</title>
	<comment>
	    is all over the place. I click on "express" bus line, but it gives me information combined both express and regular. This becomes an issue when I try to go to a place I don't usually go. Once I was dropped off 10 blocks away from where I wanted to be because of this issue. It needs to be either unique bus route for it or bus stops marked with "e" or color differentiated?

	   This app is in my top three apps that I use daily. With the new buses, I won't need it as much since I have now just one bus that gets me home, but I know I'll still obsessively check it! A must-have for any transit rider!

	   Since I have discovered this app, it has helped me get around with less anxiety, however sometimes it is very flawed. For example, it said my bus was coming in 20 minutes, and then it just switched to saying it won't come for 300 minutes. Wth???

	   this app is so useful when it works. However it often has issues . My biggest issue though is that it doesn't factor holidays at all. I've spent time waiting at a stop as it said it was coming then went into negative time. Only to find the bus was never going to come... a huge flaw for an app like this

	   Really good ap. Almost always within a 2 minute accuracy. It does get confused once in a while, usually during heavy traffic, and then can be way off. But overall great-I couldn't live without it . Suuplemental.. after a week of use, after the updrade, the accuracy has gone down. I just caught a bus tht the app said left my stop 4 min ago

	   Must be my stop, but this app is unfortunately never right for any of the routes that come by 3rd and Marion in the afternoon. You can't trust it until you're on the bus.

	   It's very accurate on arrival times and routes but there are too many glitches to outweigh the good. It's out again, claiming it can find any stops at this time.

	   It seems to work well so far. I am honestly surprised, nothing works well on my phone anymore. However, the bright green is horrendous and needs to be replaced with something less migraine inducing. I wonder if they were going for the actual metro theme colors? Eeek...

	   I have been using this Awesome Application for months now. I have never had any issues its very very accurate. I can schedule a long, multi bus trip with ease. The new UI looks great, can't wait to try it out. I would recommend this app above all else. It makes riding a bus so easy and I dont have to lug around a bunch of messy trip schedules and go by the out dated times on the outside of the bus stop.

	   Other than the occasional stale data feed works great. Use it daily. Latest update is great. Easily shows all stops on a route.

	   a necessary app if you take the bus system in Seattle. lists all bus stops by you and provides real time info for bus routes. It does not include any way of seeing bus schedules except for buses currently running but would be a bit more helpful for this app.

	<comment>
	   I rely on this app regularly. However, there are times that are extremely frustrating for me, such as setting an alert for a bus and getting to the stop in time to find the bus has already departed. Seriously. Also, if it says your bus is delayed for 45 minutes, do not trust that. Overall, love the app, but if you're really counting on the schedule, please pad your time accordingly.

	   I have been riding the bus for 5 years and the constantly having to check to see the time the bus would be there, or if the bus line went by someplace you knew where it was in the city you could find what route it was on. Only thing I don't like is that it doesn't have a list of the schedules routes, with times when they leave the transit center both out and incoming that way you can be sure what time you will to be for a connection. Other then that I absolutely love it!!!!

	   Clean, intuitive interface. I like that I can set a reminder for the last bus of the day! Granted, the times could be more accurate. But that's not entirely the app's fault -- it's only going to be as good as the data it gets from the bus companies. I depend on it to catch buses all the time, and it usually works just fine.

	   One Bus Away seems much improved, with much more accuracy about which bus is coming when, after a fairly dismal period when it was mostly wrong. Somebody is giving it some TLC, and it shows. When it works, which is mostly now, it can be extremely helpful in knowing which bus is coming when.

	<comment>
	   This app is a huge help for checking out bus status, routes, and such. My only complaint is how little info is stored locally: if you aren't able to get a signal, it becomes almost completely useless because you can't view routes, stops, or even the timetables. If this contained all the info on routes and stops with it, or allowed you to download the timetables for specific busses and stops, it would be a perfect reference guide. As it is, it's very good if you have a data plan and/or constant wifi access.

	   It's an awesome app and have saved from being late countless time. A few features that'd be amazing in future updates: - a more distinct icon for current location, too hard to see now. - keep my zoom preference when moving to my stops or current location. - refresh arrival list in time interval at bus stops. - a bit more tricky: incorporate trip planning somehow.

	   The only serious problems I've ever had are rooted in GPS issues that aren't the apps' fault. The only thing I'd change is to add the ability to search by intersection -- if the option exists currently I haven't been able to find it.

	   But it's missing a bunch of Everett Transit stops for the Seattle area. Multiple stops on East Marine View and West Marine View drives, and others that do exist. Please update you Everett Transit information, as many of us in Snohomish County commute to Seattle daily.

	   Like everyone else is stating, it's used to be accurate. As of right now, I'm sitting at my stop and have watched it say my bus is here "NOW" to 37 minutes delayed within 1 minute. It's been jumping around like this for about 2 weeks, now. Boo. :(

	<comment>
	   I need route data (numbers, stops and times). This app provides that in a slick query and display GUI. CLI or poke-a-map, I can get it fast. Timeliness is a bonus, but knowing my bus is late will not make it arrive earlier. Thanks devs but keep the natives happy ;)

	   For the 14, you are more wrong then right. In the evening you have it's departure time as the time it arrives for . It actually doesn't leave for another 10 mins or more. May 1st at Pike & 6th in have the departure time at 6:42pm. Then at 6:35pm it changed to 6:47pm. Then changed at 6:40pm to 6:57pm (the scheduled departure). The 14 is not alone. There are MANY other routes that you are not accurate with. As more routes get GPS, I hope you accuracy gets better.

	<comment>
	   The user interface could use some work. I just want to see a list of the stops I normally use when start the app. Instead, it always starts by showing a map and I have to hit menu, and then My Stops to get to the list of my stops. Sometimes it shows departure times that don't actually exist. This morning it showed MT-346 at Aurora Village at 9:00. The 346 bus came a couple minutes after 9:00, but they pulled over into the parking lane and shut off the engine, so I checked the schedule on the Metro website. The next bus was not scheduled until 9:17. It must be showing what time the bus gets there, regardless of when the next departure time is. What good is that? I only care about when the bus is going to leave. I guess it's not really designed to work if you're catching a bus at a transit center where the bus might be there, but the driver might stop to take their break or something.

	   For several months I depended on this app & it was pretty consistently accurate. For 4-6 weeks now it's been almost worthless. Busses are reported as arriving late or early when they aren't, sometimes by 20mins or more. Today my bus appeared & disappeared from the list several times. To top it off I can no longer access the bus schedules , a feature I used frequently in the past. Boo.

It's amazingly useful to all who rely on PT in the area.

	   So unfortunately metro in all their wisdom uses the odometer readings as the gauge to how far way a bus is from any given stop. No actual current speed data is availiable which renders this app much less accurate than it could be. Not the devs fault.

	<comment>
	   Usually my app works so well I love it. Just now it suddenly stopped showing me any bud stops. It knows I'm in Seattle but doesn't seem to read any bus routes in Seattle. I even did a route search and still nothing. It says my links may be out of date, so I uninstalled then installed the app again. Still nothing! I hope this is fixed by tomorrow. This app helps me catch so many buses on time!

	   The Android version leaves a lot to be desired. UPS version gives so much more info about each bus. Also, rout 577 is completely wrong.

	   Sometimes OBA is completely accurate. Sometimes it shows the bus as 20 minutes late, as the bus shows up right in front of me, on time. The travel direction indicated for some stops is wrong. Not sure where the problem is, on your end or the transit company supplying the route data, but either way it can be frustrating. It would be extremely helpful if OBA could show transit alerts, such as when busses are on re-route, or outright canceled due to inclement weather, etc.

	   When I first started using this app it was great. Now it is not accurate at all. I thought it was based on the bus location .....wrong. Many times it says a bus is coming only to be late but the app says it already came by. Is there a update for this app?

	   I love this app and use it every day. I just wish there were a way to report that a route is behind schedule. I frequently find that the app reports that my bus has departed even though it hasn't arrived yet. I can't help but feel that if users could report when the route is running behind, that I would benefit.

	<comment>
	   In general, I think this is a useful app, and I use it all the time. It's quite accurate most of the time, but occasionally buses never show up or the schedule is way off, which is likely not a problem with the app, but from the data feed they receive. My biggest complaint with the app is that it splits many routes into sections, so it only displays part of the route. This is even the case when the route number doesn't change. When it displays the route, it shows it come to end at some point, when in reality it continues. The app knows this information, because under 'Show route information' it will show the route broken up into sections, but you can't display it that way, and you have to dig around to even find that much. The iPhone version has a way to display the other section, but you have to scroll to the bottom of the list of stops. Not at all obvious. The interface is very confusing. It's much better on the iPhone. I find myself constantly clicking around trying to figure out how to get the information I'm looking for. The iPhone version is much more intuitive. A complete UI overhaul is needed, but the core functionality is good.

	   Wish the default screen was user configurable. I don't like starting with the map view. I'd. Rather have it open more like the iPhone app.

	<comment>
	   This app is a miracle. I could have never guessed that a cell phone app could make seattle bus riding bearable. My only complaint is that it can take a while track down your stop or route... but I feel like I'm looking a gift horse in the mouth when I say that.

	   This is app is wonderful, but it only works 75% of the time. I don't know if it is an issue with Metro or with the development of the app, but don't rely on it. Use it for timetable information only. The live times are not accurate in West Seattle.

	  This app is perfect! It is accurate and very useful. I know how much time I have before the next bus arrives. The map shows where the bus is and the schedules are helpful as well. Also helpful when you are in an area that you are not familiar with. I want to give this 1000 stars instead. Please keep up the goo work and keep this app alive and running for years to come.

	  Don't know how I survived the bus system before. 98% accurate (amazing). Only complaint is the map is slow sometimes, but that's no biggie. Love this!

	  Awesome. Very accurate, shows amount of time until each bus arrives at your bus stop. With GPS, it shows all bus stops nearby so you can decide. 5/5!

	  Sometimes my location is way off. I end up using the find route feature and scrolling to the stop i'm at. The timing has proven accurate. Good app.

	  Great, I use it every day. I wish I times would update faster. It would be great to see the busses like the iPhone app.

	  A truly useful tool. The clutter of stop icons make the map hard to read -- yet stops are hard to select. 5 stars anyway!

	  Excellent app. However, why no favorites? I don't want a reminder, I want to have quick access to stops I frequently visit.

	  The first person to add any type of support for community transit would be a rock star. Does not need the real-time location, just the schedules alone
